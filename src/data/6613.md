## ABSTRACT

Cycle 1 and 2 darks show an elevated and inconsistent dark rate when the instrument is open to the sky prior to the dark. The effect does not seem to scale strongly with filter or idle time. The effect is thought to be due to persistence from the sky background. We naively expect that the background in F560W is low enough to mitigate this persistence, however the one example we have with this filter prior to a dark also shows the issue. With this program we aim to reduce the number of free parameters to isolate the issue and then determine a path forward for MIRI dark current calibration.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The program consists of 3 measurements at low Zodiacal emission and 3 at high Zodiacal emission. Each measurement includes an initial, or idle, observation, to be followed by the actual dark measurement after a 20-60 minute pause with exclusive use of the instrument so that any persistence can decay.

Observations will be made in F560W with a single 5-group integration, as the Cycle 2 trending darks.
