## ABSTRACT

Galaxy mergers and interactions are important catalysts of star formation and a key process in galaxy evolution. We propose broadband MIR imaging of an interacting galaxy pair with the MIRI instrument, in fliters F770W, F1130W, and F1500W. This wide mosaic will enable detection of small scale structures of both PAH and thermal dust emission in this system.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal will use the MIRI imaging mode to obtain 3-band imaging of an interacting galaxy. The selected MIRI filters are: F770W, F1130W, F1500W. In all cases we use a 6 points dither pattern with 10 groups and 3 integrations. To cover the extent of the interacting pair we use a 2x4 mosaic. The PA is restricted to ensure adequate coverage of the parget.
