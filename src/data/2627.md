## ABSTRACT

With its sensitivity in the near- and mid-infrared, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will further push the limits of high-contrast imaging (HCI) by probing the population of young exoplanets at wide separations down to Saturn masses. Because stellar light residuals dominate over the background in regions up to 2" from the star, some crucial scientific discoveries may be missed, preventing their follow-up during the short life-span of this exceptional observatory. The current recommended strategy for JWST coronagraphic imaging involves contemporaneous calibration exposures of a reference star. Those observations, accounting at least for half the time spent observing the science target or more, are subject to wavefront drifts that prevent the subtraction of stellar light down to the photon noise level. There is a high need for an alternative strategy that would leverage our knowledge of the observatory to further improve the calibration of stellar light residuals while avoiding the need for time-consuming calibration exposures. The proposed observations will be used to test and validate a model-based phase retrieval algorithm that estimates the instrumental aberrations directly from HCI observations. Data from wavefront sensing operations will help to constrain the phase retrieval. Angular differential strategy and dual-band imaging will be used to disentangle the astrophysical signal from the residual starlight. Calibration data will be requested in the form of non-coronagraphic and coronagraphic NIRCam images just before and after WFS. The findings will be used to draw recommendations for coronagraphic imaging observing strategies in the subsequent JWST cycles.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We contacted the NIRCam helpdesk and this SMALL GO Calibration proposal was approved for submission (see ticket INC0162672).

As described in the Technical Justification, we have a detailed layout of the observations and have thought through the particular challenges posed by those observations. If accepted, we will work closely with the Space Telescpe Science Institute to make sure those observations are performed in the most efficient way and to ensure the validation of our technique of post-processing.
