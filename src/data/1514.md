## ABSTRACT

Observation of a low temperature source are to be made to test for possible long wavelength filter leaks in the NIRISS imaging mode. The target is assumed to be a 5 km diameter asteroid at a distance of approximately 2.6 AU.

Various possible targets are included but only one needs to be used. The various targets have visibility times as follows to be at the right estimated brightness for the observation:

10/01 - 10/17: (3290) Azabu
10/17 - 10/31: (8770) Totanus
10/31 - 11/13: (32788) 1989 SJ3
11/13 - 11/25: (50587) 2000 ET45
11/25 - 12/08: (7051) Sean
12/08 - 12/23: (6300) Hosamu
12/23 - 01/04: (38998) 2000 UP26

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Short observations of an asteroid are planned for all the NIRISS filters in the SUB256 sub-array and with a 4-point dithering pattern. An asteroid of about 5 km diameter and at a distance between 2.4 and 2.8 AU at the time of observation is required to match the assumed brightness. Given a time window for the observations a target can be selected but here a dummy target is used.

This calibration requires an accompanying NIRSpec observation to give a calibration of the exact spectral shape of the asteroid at the time of observation.
