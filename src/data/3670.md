## ABSTRACT

We will target a sample of abundance benchmarked brown dwarfs to create a transformative dataset that will impact substellar, exoplanetary and planetary science. JWST is unique in enabling us to:
- determine the dependence of cloud composition on Mg/Si, [M/H] and C/O to critically test cloud models

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This project will obtain low-resolution NIRSpec Prism and MIRI LRS observations covering the full 0.6 - 12micron region for a sample of benchmark brown dwarfs spannig the entire LT sequence. These observations will achieve SNR ~ 100 in the flux peaks between water bands in the JH regions of the NIRSpec data, and SNR ~ 50 - 100 in the 8-9 micron region of the MIRI-LRS data.

We will use NIRPSpec in Prism mode, and will use the same detector setup for all targets, only changing the exposure times. We will use the WATA acquisition mode with the CLEAR filter and NRSRAPID readout pattern for target acquisition for brighter targets, or NRSRAPID6 for some fainter targets. We have ensured that we will obtain SNR>30 for all targets in the NIRSpec target acquisition. For our science observations, we use the Prism/CLEAR grating/filter pair, the S200A1 slit (since each object is a point source) and will again use the NRSRAPID readout pattern. We will observe with an AB nod. We have used the JWST ETC to estimate exposure times for each target to achieve our required SNR > ~100 in the flux peaks.
For each target we used an ATMO2020 model of an appropriate Teff and log g and Solar metallicity, scaled to match the target's photometry.
We will observe in an AB nod pattern, and increase the Groups per integration until we achieve SNR > 100 in the flux peaks. Our longest exposure time for our faintest target is ~190s.

We will use MIRI LRS in slit mode using the default P750L disperser and FULL subarray, as necessary for fixed-slit observations. We will use the FAST readout pattern, which is suitable for our purposes by ensuring no saturation while also providing adequate samples up the ramp. We will obtain an AB nod pattern. For target acquisition, we use the F1000W filter, the FULL subarray, FAST readout pattern and 4 groups for all targets.We will achieve SNR > 40 in acquisition for all targets.
For LRS observations we use the FULL subarray, FAST readout pattern and an AB nod pattern for sky subtraction. We have used the JWST ETC to estimate exposure times for each target to achieve the required SNR > ~100 in the 8 micron region, and used the same ATMO models as for the NIRSpec exposure estimates. Many of our targets necessarily have bright stars nearby, and we have taken care to specify orientation ranges to ensure that these bright sources do not fall in the MIRI imager during the LRS observation.
