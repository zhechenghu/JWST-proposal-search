## ABSTRACT

This activity observes a bright, extended planetary nebula to provide illumination throughout the MIRI MRS FOV in order to derive fringe and pixel flatfields. This target was successfully used for such purposes during Cycle 1 (PID 1523) and this program repeats the observations to increase the total SNR of the derived flats as well as monitor for time variability. Observations are obtained using a dithered mosaic in order to sample the same locations on the sky with many different detector pixels (required for self-calibration).

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program observes a bright planetary nebula in a 3x3 mosaic to measure the MRS pixel and fringe flatfield in a single non-interruptible sequence of target and background.
We do not obtain simultaneous imaging as the absolute pointing of the observations is not important, and the observing setup can otherwise pose data volume challenges.
The timing of this program within Cycle 2 is unconstrained.
