## ABSTRACT

This activity will serve 4 calibration activities, all of which can be obtained by observing the LMC calibration field throughout Cycle 1: stellar flats, photometric monitor, astrometry/distortion monitor, and flux array dependence. Stellar Flats: The stellar flats (L-flats) are meant to supplement the LP-flats. These observations step well-measured stars across the detector to map changes in response across the frame. HST/WFC3 and HST/ACS stellar flats improved photometric accuracy by 0.6%-6%, depending on the filter. A dense stellar field with minimal crowding is required. Since relatively short exposures are required, stellar flats can be used to monitor changes in the wavelength dependence of the flat field since Commissioning by observing in all (wide, medium, and narrow filters). Stars will be stepped across the detectors at 9 positions. Photometric Monitor: Repeat observations of the LMC field will monitor the stability of the photometric zeropoint calibration in all filters. Astrometry/Distortion Monitor: Determine the plate scale, orientation, and geometric distortion for each SCA in each NIRCam module over the full wavelength range. This requires dithering in the LMC calibration field with a representative subset of filters. The LMC calibration field has been carefully chosen and mapped with HST's ACS to facilitate such a calibration. Characterize absolute flux array-dependence: Since absolute flux calibrators are bright, they can only be observed on small subarrays. Thus, to check the array dependence, we will include subarray observations of the LMC along with the FULL observations.
This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Apr 14 2023 MLB
Repeating failed observations:
WOPR-88607: repeat visit 23:2, which is one of the mosaic tiles in obs 3. Skipped due to guide star reacquisition failure. New visit is a copy of Obs3, with the successful tiles removed from the mosaic. I've added a PA restriction so that it occurs at an ~180 degree flip from the rest of the mosaic tiles to optimize the overlap of B3 with the other SW mod-B detectors. New visit is 103:1
WOPR-88703: repeat visit 4:1, which failed due to a guide reacquisition failure. The first dither pair (F700W/F444W) succeeded during the original observation, so we've removed that filter pair from the repeat. New visit is 104:1

--- June 29 2022 MLB (resubmitted)
Obs 1:
- put Module B at the center of the HST CAL field
Obs 3:
- put Module B at the center of the HST CAL field
- switched FGS1 --> FGS2 in parallel so FGS lands in the HAWK-I field
- Changed F070W/F444W --> F210M/F335M
Obs 6 (NEW OBSERVATION):
- duplicate of Obs 3, but with Module A in center and FGS 1 in parallel
Obs 4:
- put module A at the center of the HST CAL field.

Activity Summary text:
The LMC calibration field is in the CVZ and has ~6 stars/arcsec^2 measured in ACS F606W, which results in >25,000 stars in a SW SCA and >100,000 stars in a LW SCA. There is no strong stellar gradient, so the stars will be evenly distributed across the frame. Short exposures provide S/N > 4-10 (depending on filter) for stars with Kmag = 21 (KOIII star) and allow for the detection of faint stars while minimizing saturation effects. There will be >3000 stars per SCA with S/N > 30 and positions better than 2mas.
There will be 3 observations total. One is designed specifically for stellar flats and can also be used for astrometry and photometric monitoring. One is designed for photometric monitoring, and one for distortion monitoring.

For stellar flats (epoch 1), we will use a 5-pt INTRASCA (24”) dither. This places a star at 9 positions on each detector. This spacing is non-optimal for both the SW and LW detectors, but with enough stars, we should be able to derive L-flats (simulations are needed). All filters will be obtained for this epoch, which should be obtained 3-4 months after the Astrometry Commissioning program (NIRCam-21). This is the only epoch for creating L- flats. Science data will be used to monitor changes in the L-flat through Cycle 1. This epoch will also be used to monitor astrometry since Commissioning, and as a baseline epoch for photometric monitoring.
For the epoch 2 astrometry monitor, we will use the same setup used in Commissioning: a 2-pt INTRAMODULEBOX dither with a 2x2 mosaic (overlap 50% x 80%), which provides complete overlap between the SW detectors. However, we will only do 1 observation, so the modules will not overlap with each other and only FGS1 will be observed in parallel. This observation will observe in 3 filter pairs, and should occur >3 months after epoch 1.
For the epoch 2 photometry monitor, we will do minimal dithering with all 16 filter pairs. We will use a 2-pt INTRASCA pattern to provide the same pixel sampling obtained in the L-flat epoch. This epoch should occur about >3 months after epoch 2.
For the absolute flux array dependence, we will use SUB160 on Module B with 2 INTRAMODULEBOX dithers and 2 subarray dithers. These will only be taken in 2 filter pair (F070W+F444W & F200W+F277W), using SHALLOW4 with 10 groups and 4 integrations. By include 2 pairs, we can correct for any filter dependence in the L-flats. These should be taken as a non-interruptible sequence with epoch 1 to minimize issues with variable stars.
The stars in the LMC field span a broad magnitude range. The ACS observations suggest stars are as faint as ~23 mag in the K-band. Below are the readout patterns required to reach S/N>3 in FULL frame in every filter for a star with K=21 mag (derived from ETC). These exposure times allow for the detection of faint stars while minimizing saturation effects.
Filters Readout Setup
SW Wide filters RAPID, NGROUP=3
SW Medium filters RAPID, NGROUP=3
SW Narrow filters BRIGHT2, NGROUP=4
LW Wide filters RAPID, NGROUP=3
LW Medium filters (F250M-F410M) RAPID, NGROUP=3
LW Medium filters (F430M-F480M) BRIGHT2, NGROUP=4
LW Narrow filters SHALLOW4, NGROUP=5
TIMING CONSTRAINTS: We will obtain 1 epoch with the stellar flat setup, 1 epoch with the astrometry monitor, and 1 epoch with the photometric monitor setup. The L-flat epoch should be taken about 3-4 months after the astrometry Commissioning activity (NIRCam-21), and the astrometry and photometry monitoring epochs should occur with a minimum cadence of 3 months. These 3 epochs must be spread throughout Cycle 1 because mirror rephasing will affect astrometry. Since this affect is strongest for NIRCam, a minimum of 3 epochs in Cycle 1 is needed. The subarray observations should be taken as a non-interruptible sequence with epoch 1.
--- July 2019 MLB
Fixed timing constraints to spread epochs out over cycle 1.
Added a SUB160 observation in 2 filters pairs that will be used for the absolute flux program. These should be non-interruptible with epoch 1 to make sure we are not affected by stellar variability, etc. These will allow us to check the array dependence of the flux, since the absolute calibrators can only be observed on small subarrays. Including 2 filters per channel to check for any filter dependence of the L-flat.
NOTE: Can probably remove the SUB160 observation, but it depends on how Part 4 of the absolute flux program shapes up. Keeping it here for now.

This is the Slimmer version of CAL-NRC-003. Description of how I shortened each epoch is below.
Goals:
1) Solve for/monitor astrometry
2) monitor photometric stability
3) Create L-flats
Epoch 1:
Designed for L-flats, but not optimally. Obtained for all filters. Places stars at 9 evenly spaced positions on every detector, with the step size that balances both the SW and LW detector sizes. The pattern too large for SW and too small for LW, but with enough stars, we will probably be OK. Need to simulate how this will affect the L-flats. This epoch also provides the photometry baseline for photometric monitoring & it can be used to check the distortion.
Epoch 2:
Near-optimal astrometry setup, similar to Commissioning program. Just 3 filter pairs, but all SW detectors are overlapped onto each other. The slim program sacrefices LW overlap and puts only FGS1 in parallel. This is our final distortion monitor. Should occur about 6 months after epoch 1.
Epoch 3:
Optimal setup for phometric monitoring. All 16 filter pairs, minimal dithering. Uses same dither pattern as Epoch 1 so that the pixel sampling is the same. This is our final dedicated photometric monitor. Additional monitoring will be done with science data. Should occur about 6 months after epochl. Only way to shorten is to not do every filter: maybe drop the filters that are heavily used in Cycle 1 (b/c can use Science data to monitor those filters). But will leave it as is even for the Slim version.
--- In APT 26.1 (no custom dithers) ---
For the Stellar flats: Each detector is sampled well enough to place a star at 9 positions evenly across the detector. This is achieved with a combination of INTRASCA dithers and a 2x2 mosaic. Adding custom dithers would allow us to drop the mosaic, saving overheads and filter wheel moves.
