## ABSTRACT

We propose to perform a slitless spectroscopic survey with NIRCam/WFSS targeting the COSMOS-Web field together with deep parallel MIRI imaging, to establish a treasury dataset covering the largest ever field (0.33 deg2, including 500 arcmin^2 with MIRI) in the infrared, and secure redshifts of ~20000 galaxies and 5000 AGN over a survey volume of 3x10^7 Mpc^3, including >4000 galaxies and up to 500 AGN at z>5, into the epoch of reionization (EoR), providing a true 3-D panoramic view of the early Universe and addressing the following key scientific questions:

(1) How did the early massive galaxies emerge? Do they pose a challenge to modern cosmology? We will measure unbiased 3-d galaxy correlation function at EoR to map the growth of early dark matter halos and unveil the earliest galaxy protoclusters.

(2) How did the early supermassive black holes (SMBHs) emerge? What is the nature of the puzzling 'Little Red Dots' unveiled by JWST? The survey will provide a complete AGN census in the early universe to probe the modes of early SMBH accretion and growth.

(3) How did 'Cosmic Web' of the Universe emerge? What's the sources of reionization? How did galaxies and SMBHs evolve in that context? The survey will produce the first IGM tomographic map at EoR and trace IGM/galaxy connections from cosmic noon to reionization.

This treasury dataset will enable a wide-range of extragalactic science, including the measurements of high-z galaxy luminosity function, census of dusty galaxies across cosmic time, supernovae and AGN detections through variability. The team will provide fully reduced spectra and valued added spectroscopic and photometric catalogs to the community.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We aim at performing a wide-field slitless spectroscopy with NIRCam/WFSS over 0.33 deg^2 in the COSMOS-Web footprint. This treasury program will deliver the largest ever infrared redshift survey for galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR) and enable countless scientific investigations by the community for the next decade. This program will provide a panoramic view of the early universe by studying the emergence of early large scale structure, the tomography of the intergalactic medium in the EoR and the history of early SMBH growth. In addition, this program will produce key additions to the multi-wavelength dataset in the COSMOS field, with slitless spectroscopy, mid-IR extension and time-domain coverage, and enable a wide range of investigations in extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology. This treasury program contains the following two main components.

**1) NIRCam/WFSS observations.**
We will use the F444W filter for the WFSS observations in the long wavelength channel and obtain deep imaging at 2um with F200W in the short wavelength channel. We will also obtain F115W+F356W direct imaging (both in-field and out-of-field) after the WFSS exposure. To reduce overhead, we will only use Grism-R for the WFSS observations. The confusion will be resolved by the detection of multiple emission lines and the fruitful multi-wavelength data available in the COSMOS field. Since the JWST Cycle 1 program contains deep enough F444W imaging, we do not use F444W for the direct imaging observations. This program adds two new filters (F200W+F356W) to the COSMOS field and adds a second epoch of F115W observations. The new F115W observation will nearly double the on-source exposure time of the COSMOS-Web F115W observations and enable time domain studies.

Our observations will be splitted into 20 2x4 mosaics with each mosaic covering ~60arcmin^2. We will use the INTROMODULEX primary dither and 2-point sub-pixel dither for the observation. We explore the SHALLOW4 readout pattern, 6 Groups and 1 Integrations which gives an on-source exposure time of 1868 sec for the F444W WFSS and F200W imaging observations. The direct imaging in F115W+F356W will be obtained with the same configuration and gives a maximum on-source exposure time of 934 sec.

**2) MIRI parallel observations.**
We will obtain coordinated MIRI parallel imaging in F1000W+F2100W. The F2100W imaging will be obtained together with NIRCam WFSS observations. The on-source exposure time for F2100W is 1848 sec. We will obtain MIRI F1000W imaging in parallel when doing NIRCam direct imaging. This program will provide the largest (482 arcmin^2) deep mid-infrared imaging survey at 10-20um, with the key science goal of detecting hot dust emission from early accreting SMBHs and dusty galaxies.

To optimize the overlapped MIRI imaging between this program and the COSMOS-Web F770W MIRI imaging and the NIRCam imaging, we will use two sets of aperture angles when observing. We will perform most (80%) of the observations with PA=110, the same as half of the COSMOS-Web NIRCam observations. We request a small fraction (20%) of the observations to be performed with PA=290.
