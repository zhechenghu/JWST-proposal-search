## ABSTRACT

This program executes successive rotations of the GWA (grating wheel assembly), one position at a time, with an internal lamp exposure taken at each position (LINE4 for the PRISM, REF for the gratings). The data will enable monitoring of the calibration of the GWA tilt sensors, which is a critical part of the NIRSpec wavelength calibration. This calibration is part of the NIRSpec instrument model, but the tilt sensors are more likely to change with time than the other internal instrument model components and will be monitored more frequently. The monitor will run approximately once every 4 weeks to provide data on the GWA tilt behavior and build up statistics for a full tilt calibration if necessary. See APT file proposal description section for more detailed information. This Cycle 3 program is essentially identical to the structure of the Cycle 2 program 4463, which had implemented a new and more efficient scheduling structure that was developed part way through the execution of the Cycle 1 program (1491).

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The exposures taken at each GWA position are very short (1.5-3 minutes); in order to be able to fit observations into slews, we have split an individual rotation set into three observations, each with two or three wheel positions (obs 1: PRISM/LINE4, G395M/REF, G235M/REF; obs 2: G140M/REF, G395H/REF; obs 3: G235H/REF, G140H/REF). We added a timing requirement so that each set of three observations is taken within a 48-hour period (revised from 24-hours after early Cycle 1 experience provided a better understanding of the typical frequency and length of slews). This new structure worked well in Cycle 2 and will be continued in Cycle 3 with no changes apart from actual date ranges appropriate to Cycle 3.

Thirteen observation sets are included in the program. Each observation set or observing epoch is constrained to be scheduled within a 4-week period via BETWEEN special requirements (SR).
The individual observation sets, which are all conducted as slew parallels, are required to complete within 2 days.via GROUP WITHIN SR and all members of a set also are required to execute within the same BETWEEN interval.
There is no constraint on the order of execution of the observations within an individual observation set.

The structure of the observing design is based upon experience gained in the Cycle 1 version of this program (PID 1491) and verified by continued successful execution in Cycle 2 (PID 4463) :
- all exposures use FIXEDSLIT
- no SEQUENCE WITHIN SR are used as these inhibit easy scheduling. hence GROUP WITHIN SRs are used
- GROUP WITHIN intervals of less than 2 days are difficult to schedule in most OPs.
- BETWEEN dates should be explicitly included for each individual observation in an observation set.
- There is no constraint on the order of execution of the observations within an individual observation set.
- adjust starting and ending dates to corresppond to nominal Monday/Sunday OP starting/ending dates to maximize likelihood of scheduling in any individual OP.

**TIMING CONSTRAINTS**
Timing constraints assume a start for Cycle 3 on 1 July 2024 and nominal end date of 30 June 2025. .
The cadence should be one epoch per every regular 4-week interval in the cycle.
For each epoch, the 3 observations are grouped with the constraint that they be observed within 2 days of each other and the same BETWEEN interval is explicitly specified for each member of the observation set.
The first epoch BETWEEN interval is scheduled to start on the first Monday closest to (typically following or on) 1 July 2024 (i.e., 1 July 2024). Each epoch then has a between range set 4 weeks later than for the previous epoch in order to monitor for changes with a regular cadence. This timing is critical to establishing a baseline and data monitor throughout the cycle.
The 4-week windows for each epoch are meant to give schedulers some flexibility, while trying to achieve a regular cadence for better monitoring.

In the event of a change in the start of Cycle 3 by more than a few days, the time constraints will most likely need to be adjusted for all observations by that length of time.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.
