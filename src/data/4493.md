## ABSTRACT

Observations of a standard star with the four coronagraphic filters in the imaging field using full-frame readout will provide a photometric calibration for science observations in the same configuration. For each filter, we will obtain a aubarray calibration transfer from the coronagraphic subarrays to the full-array readout. For the F1065C, F1140C, and F1550C filters, the new observations will also account for the fact that the four-quadrant phase masks are not in the optical path to the imaging field.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This activity consists of a single observation of the standard star HD 2811, using all 4 coronagraphic filters, but with full-frame readout.

No constraints have been placed on the time when the observation is obtained.
