## ABSTRACT

Time-series observations of rotational modulations in brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions are a powerful tool to characterize ultra-cool atmospheres. Nearly 100 of these objects have been shown to have rotational variability with the long-term assumption that this was being driven by evolving heterogeneous cloud coverage, but this has never been unequivocally proven as there has never been a mid-IR spectral variability campaign where the signatures of such clouds are detectable at $\sim$10\micron{}. In the last decade, chemical disequilibrium-induced convection has been proposed as another potential mechanism that can explain rotational variability, with the spectral signature for this being most prominent between 3 to 5 \micron{}. This debate can only be settled by using JWST's mid-IR spectral capabilities. Therefore, we propose spectral monitoring of VHS 1256 b, the most variable substellar object. Specifically, we will combine extremely high S/N and interleaved NIRSpec/PRISM, NIRSpec/G395H/F290LP, and MIRI/LRS spectroscopy to map the evolution of the near-IR variability relative to the signatures of the two proposed mechanisms across a full 22-hour rotation. VHS 1256 b was a JWST ERS target which resulted in a high-quality 1 to 28 \micron{} spectrum. Our program will add a unique and critical dimension to the analysis of this data and allow us to break a model degeneracy which will have a stark implication on both 1- and 3-D modeling approaches. We wave the proprietary data period and will make any resulting data reduction tools available to the community in order for it to serve as a springboard for similar variability investigative proposals in future cycles.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We observe VHS 1256b using NIRSpec PRISM, NIRSpec G395H/F290LP, and MIRI LRS in time series mode to observe its spectroscopic variability. For NIRSpec, we use the BOT template; for MIRI, we use LRS time series observations. We cycle through the three modes to cover one rotation (22 hr) of VHS 1256 b.
We optimize group and integration numbers for cadence and SNR. For prism observations, we use the SUB 512 subarray, NRS readout pattern, 20 groups per integration, and 4 integration per exposure. This provides an S/N of 447 at 2.95 microns.
For G395H observations, we use the SUB2048 subarray, NRS readout pattern, 110 groups per integration and 7 integration per exposure. This provides an SNR of 626 at 3.50 microns.
For MIRI LRS observations, we use the slitless mode, FASTR1 readout patter, 360 groups per integration and 35 integrations per exposure. This provides an SNR of 627 at 10 microns.
Each time we switch to NIRSpec or MIRI we allow for the 30 minute detector setling period.
We cycle the three modes for nine times to achieve the 22 hr baseline.
