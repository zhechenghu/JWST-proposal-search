## ABSTRACT
We propose to measure the radii of 36,000 compact star clusters in 38 nearby galaxies, the largest such sample to-date, using new JWST NIRCam imaging. The study outlined in this AR proposal will increase the number of clusters with published radii by a factor of four, and double the number of galaxies with such measurements. Compared to previous best radius measurements with HST, JWST imaging offers higher spatial resolution, less extinction, and better SED coverage. We will adapt a publicly-available custom pipeline that has been demonstrated to accurately and robustly measure the radii of star clusters in HST imaging. With this uniformly measured sample we will obtain the distribution of cluster radii and internal densities, determine the cluster mass-radius relation, and investigate the variation of cluster properties with age across diverse galactic environments. These measurements will enable an unprecedented examination of the formation and long-term evolution of star clusters.
