## ABSTRACT

> The exoplanetary system around Beta Pictoris is the one of the nearest and best studied planetary systems. High contrast imaging has revealed the presence of a ~10 MJup planet with an orbital semi-major axis ~10 AU (Lagrange et al. 2009). ALMA CO J=1-0 observations have revealed offset emission that may be generated by collisional destruction of CO rich cometary bodies, trapped into a mean motion resonance with a second undetected planet (Dent et al. 2014). Multi-wavelength imaging observations have revealed a spectacular edge-on disk extending up to ~1400 AU away from the star in scattered light and thermal emission.
>
> We plan to obtain a MIRI MRS (5 tile by 1 tile) mosaic at ~5-28 micron of the inner ~9” (180 AU) of the Beta Pic disk to map the shapes of the 10 and 20 micron silicate emission features as a function of position from the central star. Herschel PACS mapping of the 69 micron Forsterite feature indicates that (1) the silicates have an Iron fraction (Mg2-2xFe2xSiO4, x~0.29) consistent with asteroids that (2) have been processed at high temperatures even at large distances from the star (de Vries et al. 2012). By contrast, higher spatial resolution Subaru mid-infrared COMICS spectra indicate the silicates are Mg-rich with the crystalline component centered on the star and small grains located at 6.4, 16, and 30 AU from the star (Okamoto et al. 2004). We plan to place our observations into context with NIRCam and MIRI coronagraphic observations of the disk imaged at high SNR in scattered light and thermal emission in a collaborative program with Telescope Scientist Matt Mountain.
>
> We constrain the timing for the mosaic to force the disk to be parallel to the long direction of the rectangular mosaic to facilitate extraction of the spectrum along the disk midplane as a function of position from the central star. Assuming that the disk has a position angle 32 degrees East of North and that slicer optics are rotated by -8 degrees in the V2, V3 coordinate system, we require a spacecraft PA of 18 - 30 degrees.
>
> In addition, we plan to observe beta Pic Moving Group member eta Tel, another young A-type member with gas emission (C II, Riviere-Marichalar et al. 2014) and a weak silicate emission feature (Chen et al. 2006). ESO 3.6 m/TIMMI2 observations in the N (12.9 micron) and Q2 filters suggest that the bright, thermal emission from the disk will be compact (<0.5", Smith et al. 2010). Thus, we observe eta Tel with a single, dithered pointing.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

> This observation uses the MIRI MRS Ch1-4 to map silicate emission in the extended, edge-on disk around beta Pic and the compact disk around eta Tel.
>
> The beta Pic disk has been observed at MIRI infrared wavelengths using Gemini/T-ReCS (Telesco et al. 2000) and Spitzer/MIPS (Ballering et al. 2016) with a position angle of 32 deg (East from North) and a radial extent of 20". We have constructed a MIRI MRS mosaic (5 row x 1 column) that we constrain to be executed when the disk is aligned with the long direction of the mosaic. This forces the MRS slices to be nearly orthogonal to the disk.For each mosaic tile, we enable a 4-point extended source map to improve subslice sampling for improve spatial resolution when our image cubes are combined. Assuming that the slicer optics are rotated by -8 degrees in the V2, V3 coordinate system and a 0.97" dither along the slice direction, we therefore require a spacecraft PA of 16 - 32 degrees.
>
> The eta Tel disk has been observed at MIRI infrared wavelengths using ESO 3.6 m/TIMMI2 (Smith et al. 2010) and Spitzer/MIPS (Rebull et al. 2008) and appears marginally spatially resolved with a disk radius ~0.5" (24 AU). Since the eta Tel disk is compact, we observe this target using a single mosaic tile. In addition, we place no constraints on when this observation can be executed.
