## ABSTRACT

This program will allow an initial characterization of the throughput, wavelength solution and background structure for the NIRCam Dispersed Hartmann sensor on the SW channel. The aim is to inform future decisions for the detailed implementation of Time-Series spectroscopy using the DHS0 and the LW GRISMR simultaneously. This science enhancement is currently under development with a goal to be offered in future JWST cycles.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

**OBSERVING DESCRIPTION**
*************
**Flux Calibration:**
we will be executing 2 Observations of the CALSPEC standard LAWD-52 (GRW+70 5824). Within each observation we will be taking a short direct imaging exposure and a longer spectroscopic exposure. The direct image will allow us to relate the 10 DHS spectral traces to the direct image location using the same channel (as opposed to relying on LW->SW channel transformations).
*************
**Wavelength calibration:**
we will be executing 2 Observations of the LMC planetary nebula IRAS-05248-7007. As for flux calibration, we will be taking an imaging exposure, followed by a spectroscopic one.
For both flux and wavelength calibration, 2 observations are necessary to probe 2 different fiducial points, corresponding to the 2 LW fiducial points for filter F444W and filters (F277W, F322W2, F356W). In order to simultaneously obtain spectra onto the SW detectors for all 10 “grism-lets” of the DHS0, we will use an offset special requirement to shift the fiducial points along the y-axis, to a location that will place the 10 DHS spectra symmetrically wrt the y-axis of the A1 and A3 detectors. The x-location of the pointing will be the same as for LW Grism Time Series allowing thus a very similar wavelength coverage.
*************
**Background measurements:**
given the slitless nature of the DHS and the complex footprint of the spectra (each source produces 10 different spectra, spaced by about 120 SW pixels in the cross-dispersion direction) the structure of the background in a DHS observation is bound to be very complex. In an exercise akin to what has been done for NIRISS/SOSS, we will be obtaining 1 observation of the zodiacal background, using a large number of dithers to average out the effect of point sources while building up SNR.

NOTE: The background observation is now setup at a combination of ecliptic and galactic coordinates that allows scheduling all the dithers in a single visit, provides a good background flux (we are close to the ecliptic midplane) and avoids region too close to the galactic plane (galactic latitude ~ 30), in order to avoid being overwhelmed by the presence of point sources.
This is implicitly a timing constraint related to the target's visibility.
Theoretically, other locations along the ecliptic -at even larger galactic latitudes -would be viable, and allow more flexible scheduling. However, as their galactic longitude changes, so does the visit splitting distance, hence the overall overhead might increase.
