## ABSTRACT

Quasar outflows are among the leading internal negative-feedback processes to explain the inside-out quenching of star formation in massive galaxies and the tight SMBH-spheroid mass relation. The likely culprits, the fast-accreting quasars, are common at the epoch of peak SMBH accretion but rare locally, making it hard to catch and study this negative-feedback phenomenon in action, even with JWST. Fortunately, there is one spectacular exception: PDS 456, the most luminous quasar in the local universe. Clear unambiguous signatures of outflows have been detected in this object on all scales, ranging from the X-ray/UV-detected relativistic wind on sub-pc accretion-disk scales to the galaxy-wide warm-ionized and cold-molecular outflows which extend to at least 10 kpc. The energetics of the outflow indicate that it is potentially able to rapidly quench star formation in the host although the current observations are still missing the critically important coronal-ionized, neutral-atomic, and warm-molecular gas phases to determine if the quasar actually affects the host evolution. The proposed NIRSpec and MIRI data cubes, analyzed with the highly optimized PSF decomposition software package IFSFIT, will allow us to (1) get an accurate and complete census of the outflow energetics, (2) constrain the dominant mechanisms that drive this outflow and AGN duty cycle, and (3) characterize the impact of the quasar outflow and intense radiation field on the physical state of the host ISM, coeval star formation activity, and circumgalactic medium. These exquisite data will serve as a local template to help interpret the coarser data from scheduled GTO/ERS JWST studies of distant quasars.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe PDS 456 using the NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs with the following settings:

-NIRSpec IFU with G235H/F170LP
data acquisition starts on the quasar itself, before a shift 0.5" S to capture blobs A and B
4-point dither pattern
20 groups and 5 integrations per dither position
Readout mode: NRSRAPID
--> total exposure time on source: 75 min
1 leakage exposure at one dither position: 11 min

-MIRI IFU with the SHORT, MEDIUM, and LONG wavelength settings
data acquisition starts on the quasar itself (with FND filter), before a shift 0.5" S to capture blobs A and B
4-point all-wavelength extended source dither pattern
40 groups and 5 integrations per dither position for each wavelength setting
Readout mode: FAST
--> total exposure time on source: 3 x 37 min = 111 min
One simultaneous background image in F770W interspaced between each spectral setting
--> exposure time for interspaced F770W images: 244 sec each
1 off-source background data cube
(obtained immediately after the on-source cube using the same settings as the on-source data cube)
--> total exposure time on background: 3 x 37 min = 111 min
--> exposure time for simultaneous interspaced F770W images: 244 sec each
