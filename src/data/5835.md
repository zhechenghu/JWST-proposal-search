## ABSTRACT

We propose to perform JWST NIRCam coronagraphic imaging observations of a selection of stars within the Beta Pictoris Moving Group. This survey will be sensitive to an unexplored population of sub-Jupiter and sub-Saturn mass exoplanets at separations beyond 10 au. At present, and for the foreseeable future, only JWST has the capabilities in wavelength coverage and infrared sensitivity required to access this region of parameter space. The sub-Jupiter demographic constraints provided by this survey will be the most precise to date for separations >10 au, and are crucial step towards understanding the overall architectures of planetary systems. Furthermore, by constraining the occurrence of these objects we will also improve our understanding on a range of ongoing questions relating to: planetary scattering, the population of free-floating planets, and the structures of debris disks. Crucially, the wide-separation sub-Jupiters discovered through this survey will be the only sample amenable to follow-up JWST characterisation observations across future cycles. Our sensitivity stretches to 0.1 Jupiter masses or lower, corresponding to objects as cool as ~250K. Future JWST imaging or spectroscopic observations of these objects will provide a unique opportunity for comparison to other objects across the transiting, directly imaged, brown dwarf, and free-floating populations, and are an essential step towards understanding the overall diversity of sub-stellar atmospheres.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will perform NIRCam dual-band coronagraphic imaging of 57 targets within the Beta Pictoris Moving Group, using the MASK335R coronagraphic mask in combination with the F200W+F444W filters. Each target exposure has been set to approximately 30 minutes, and the specific readout parameters for a given observation are obtained and optimised using PanCAKE simulations of reach individual target. PanCAKE is an extension of the official JWST exposure time calculator. We anticipate reaching a median mass sensitivty of 0.5 Mjup at 0.5", 0.2 MJup at 2", and 0.15 Mjup at separations outside of the contrast limited regime.
Before each observation, we will perform full-frame astrometric confirmation imaging to verify that each target is correctly aligned with the coronagraphic mask. Target acquisition observations will be performed in the F335M filter, and none of the selected targets require the use of the ND square to avoid saturation. Specific TA readout parameters were selected using the official JWST exposure time calculator for each individual target and are recorded in workbooks 175642 and 176078. In all cases we target a signal-to-noise greater than 100 to ensure optimal coronagraphic alignment and PSF subtraction.
We do not perform dedicated reference target observations and will instead perform self-referencing to facilitate PSF subtraction through reference differential imaging. Such a strategy is recommended in situations where a large number of targets are not expected to have a circumstellar detection, with a maximum predicted number of detections of 17, at least 40 targets will be fully suited to be used for PSF subtraction. To improve the compatability of PSFs across targets, our observations have been split into 10 non-interruptible sequences ranging from 4-6 targets per sequence. Selection of sequences has been chosen to balance schedulability and matching of spectral types, and acts to reduce the overall required telescope time by reducing the size of observatory slews.
