## ABSTRACT

The most massive galaxies in the universe formed in intense dust-enshrouded bursts very early in the history of the universe. These early gas- and dust-rich starbursts have awaited the sensitivity, resolution, and wavelength coverage of JWST for decades. We propose a comprehensive imaging and IFU spectroscopic study of the SPT0346-52 compact hyperstarburst galaxy at z=5.7. With an astounding 3000Msun/yr of star formation packed into a r~0.6kpc region and no sign of an AGN, this system is uniquely compact and intense among all known high-z galaxies. Our observations will finally detect the stellar emission from this extreme galaxy, dissect the physical conditions of the HII regions, and probe for an AGN from a novel angle for high-z dust-enshrouded systems. These data will place this system in the larger context of massive galaxy formation and enable unprecedented detail in our understanding of a primeval massive starburst.
