## ABSTRACT

**ABSTRACT**
CAL-MIRI-003
The MIRI detectors must be calibrated for a variety of effects, including the reset switch charge decay (RSCD). The RSCD leads to a difference between the slope of the first integration in a series compared to later integrations, and it depends significantly on the illumination level of the previous integration. This calibration activity obtains data to characterize the RSCD and improves the corrective algorithms applied by the calibration pipeline. By using the MIRI internal calibration lamps with different imaging filters and the three MRS grating settings, we will obtain a variety of illumination levels. These data will be combined with darks to constrain and improve the correction algorithm.

This APT file includes all CCC-closed darks, including those from the initial suite of full-array darks from CAL-MIRI-001, and the full-array darks from CAL-MIRI-003.

The SUB256 darks for CAL-MIRI-003 are now included in the APT file for PID 1517, and the lamp-on observations for CAL-MIRI-003 are included in the APT file for PID 1518.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
CAL-MIRI-003 consists of five calibration sequences, but only one appears in this APT file
A. Dark sequence in FULL array, all 3 detectors, CCC closed, to be obtained in parallel - in this file
The five observations step through the sequence of N groups x 5 integrations in FASTR1.
N = 5, 10, 20, 50, 100
B. FULL imager detector illuminated with the calibration lamp - in APT file for PID 1518
The 3 observations use the F560W, F1000W, and F1800W filters for low, medium, and high fluxes.
Each observation steps through the same group x integration sequence as the darks (A).
C. MRS detectors illuminated with the calibration lamp - in APT file for PID 1518
As (B), except that the three grating settings are used for low, medium, and high fluxes.
D. Dark sequence in SUB256 subarray, CCC open, to be obtained in parallel - in APT file for PID 1517
Organized as the FULL dark sequence (A).
E. SUB256 subarray illuminated with the calibration lamp - in APT file for PID 1518
Organized as the FULL lamp sequence (B).
This APT file includes all CCC-closed darks obtained in CAL-MIRI-001 and CAL-MIRI-003
All observations should be obtained in parallel
F. CAL-MIRI-001 - Initial darks, FASTR1, tailored for the reset anomaly
Obs 1-18 - Full array, all detectors, obtained in 50 groups x 3 integrations
G. CAL-MIRI-001 - Initial darks, FASTR1, tailored for the dark current
Obs 19-21 - Full array, all detectors, obtained in 360 groups x 1 integration
H. CAL-MIRI-001 - Initial darks, SLOWR1, tailored for the dark current
Obs 22-24 - Full array, all detectors, obtained in 40 groups x 3 integrations
A. CAL-MIRI-003 - Obs 22-26 - described above
