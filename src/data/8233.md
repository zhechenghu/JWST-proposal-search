## ABSTRACT

We propose to observe two transits of HAT-P-13b using JWST's NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments to perform the first atmospheric characterization of this unique exoplanet. HAT-P-13b stands out due to its precise Love number measurement, comparable to those of Solar System planets, offering valuable insights into its internal structure. However, the planet's atmosphere remains unexplored, and measuring its atmospheric metallicity is crucial to fully interpreting its internal composition. This proposal aims to achieve two primary objectives: (1) Determine the atmospheric metallicity of HAT-P-13b by targeting the CO2 spectral feature at 4.5 microns and H2O features at wavelengths below 4 microns, and (2) Use this data to refine models of the planet's interior structure. Combining atmospheric metallicity with the Love number will make HAT-P-13b one of the most comprehensively understood exoplanets, setting a new benchmark for planetary studies and enhancing our understanding of planetary formation and evolution.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will take two observational sequences of HAT-P-13b, one with NIRISS GR700XD and a second with NIRSpec G395M. Both observations will be taken while HAT-P-13b is transiting its host star.
