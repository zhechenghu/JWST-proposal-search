## ABSTRACT

Parallel dark exposures are taken in the NIS read-out for detector monitoring and the production of reference files for the JWST data reduction pipeline. The current proposed cadence is one set of darks per 2 months, and hence 6 sets per year. Each set consists of 4 parallel observations. The individual observations are for 5 integrations per exposure with 30 groups per integration, to be under the 10000 second limit for observations to avoid HGA moves. It is likely that the HGA moves are of no concern for the dark measurements, but this is required to avoid errors in the APT file.
This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request a series of NIS mode darks for NIRISS during cycle 1. These are split into 24 individual observations of 2.14 hours each for easier scheduling. The request is to get 4 such observations in each of 6 time periods spread over the year.
Analogous darks for the NISRAPID read-out and sub-array read-outs are requested in programs 1497 and 1499, scheduled in 20 other two-week periods for program 1497 and in the same windows for program 1499.
