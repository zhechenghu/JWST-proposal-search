## ABSTRACT

We will perform a LRS spectroscopy of a known ALMA source at z=1.99 (ALMA-10 with F560W=21.5 mag) and slitless LRS spectroscopy of its surroundings.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

In the first observation, ALMA-10 will be observed through the LRS slit, and 2 'along-slit-nod' dithered exposures will be obtained. A verification image in F560W will be obtained so that we can characterize the slit placement and slit losses. We will not do a TA based on negative experience of TA failure from other programs, and our coordinates are accurate and the target is extended. The observations would be repeated with Y-offstes of +/- 0.4 arcseconds.

For the second observation, following a pos-targ movement, we will obtain a 2 (spatial) by 2 (spectral) mosaic (with offsets 7/10 arcsec) to make a dithrered slitless observation of the MIRI imager field in the surroundings of ALMA-10 (it will be included in all 4 exposures). A verification image will be obtained. We are aware the the pipeline currently does not support the calibration of such data (we will develop our own methods for this).
