## ABSTRACT

We propose an experiment to investigate the growing tension in measurements of the Hubble constant by measuring the most crowded, or “dirtiest”, extragalactic Cepheids in SNe Ia hosts, and comparing them with the least crowded ones, already observed by two teams in JWST Cycle 1. The unmatched resolution of JWST can largely resolve the local environs of HST Cepheids to separate these crucial standard candles from the photometric “chaff” that surrounds them and reduce the associated noise in their period-luminosity relations by nearly an order of magnitude. These crowded Cepheids provide the best leverage to discover unexpected crowding affecting Cepheid photometry at HST resolution. If JWST observations of the Cepheids in the proposed 6 hosts of 8 SNe Ia match HST, it will prove beyond reproach that HST measurements are reliable over the full range used to measure H_0, while improving the least accurate of them. But if a photometric difference were found between JWST and HST, one which systematically grows with local stellar density, it would provide a clear detection of unexpected backgrounds unseen at the resolution of HST and allow us to calibrate their impact on the Tension. These observations will also advance two independent distance indicators that also calibrate SNe Ia and measure H_0 -the IR Tip of the Red Giant Branch (IR-TRGB) and Oxygen-rich Miras - providing a multi-pronged approach to demonstrate whether the H_0 tension is a robust feature of the Universe thus indicating the likely presence of missing physics in the cosmological model.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose observations of over 250 known Cepheids in three filters in six galaxies hosting 8 SNe Ia while simultaneously measuring the TRGB in halo fields in the hosts and decontaminating the Mira Period Luminosity relation in two hosts.
