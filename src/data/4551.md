## ABSTRACT

This program observes the two existing sightlines that have strong ice absorption at 3 microns and measured UV extinction curves. Both sightlines probe the Taurus molecular cloud. The observations will allow the MIR extinction from 5-28 microns to be measured, both continuum and features. The results will be used to probe the impact of ice on the dust grain properties alone and through comparision to results from two cycle 1 GO programs.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Both targets are quite bright and high S/N observations can be obtained with relatively short exposure times. All 3 grating settings are included with a 4-pt dither pattern. The observations follow best practices for MIRI MRS observations of bright point sources. Exposure times increased given the increase of 0.1 hours to the allocated time.
