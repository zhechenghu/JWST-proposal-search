## ABSTRACT

This proposal seeks to obtain the first observational evidence that compact object mergers involving a neutron star are capable of producing the third-peak $r$-process elements as well as characterize the diversity of kilonova elemental abundances to constrain kilonova modeling. The kilonova will be detected and identified by an optical or infrared sky survey, and spectroscopically confirmed. The observations consist of three epochs from approximately 25 to 70 days post-merger: (1) NIRSPEC + MIRI spectroscopy, (2) NIRSPEC + MIRI spectroscopy, and (3) NIRSPEC spectroscopy + MIRI imaging.

These observations will: (i) obtain spectroscopy with high SNR for a broad wavelength range to detect and identify as many spectral features as possible, (ii) precisely measure the full infrared spectral energy distribution to inform theoretical ejecta models, identify ejecta mechanisms, and produce the first MIR spectroscopy of a kilonova, and (iii) measure the change in bolometric luminosity between epochs to reveal dominant radioactive isotopes in the ejecta and constrain the presence of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.

We waive our proprietary rights to enable the whole community to benefit from these data.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The observations consist of three epochs of a spectroscopically confirmed kilonova at late time, likely discovered by an optical or infrared sky survey. There are a total of six observations across three epochs:

**Epoch 1:** ~25-35 days post merger
This requires a non-disruptive ToO.
Two components grouped together:
NIRSPEC low-resolution spectroscopy with the S200A1 fixed slit
MIRI low-resolution slit spectroscopy

**Epoch 2:** ~40-50 days post merger
5-25 days after the first epoch.
Two components grouped together:
NIRSPEC low-resolution spectroscopy with the S200A1 fixed slit
MIRI low-resolution slit spectroscopy

**Epoch 3:** ~60-70 days post merger
25-45 days after the first epoch.
Two components grouped together:
NIRSPEC low-resolution spectroscopy with the S200A1 fixed slit
MIRI imaging in the F560W and F770W filters
