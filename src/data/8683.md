## ABSTRACT

One of the biggest unsolved mysteries in the study of massive stars is the sudden weakening of spectroscopic wind emission signatures below a luminosity of log(L/Lsol)=5.2. This phenomenon was first identified 20 years ago, and has been labeled the 'weak-wind' problem as hydrodynamical simulations of O-type star atmospheres (which match observations above log(L/Lsol)=5.2) predict mass-loss rates two orders of magnitude higher than those required to reproduce the observed optical and UV spectra. A breakthrough moment is now happening with the detection of highly ionised fine structure emission lines (of [Ne VI], [Ne V] and [O IV]) formed in the stellar wind of late O-type stars with JWST/MIRI. These lines provide strong, independent constraints on the stellar mass-loss rate and terminal wind speed of the 'weak-wind' O9V star 10 Lac. Here we propose a MIRI spectroscopic survey of 16 late O-type stars covering a range of luminosities (log(L/Lsol)=4.7 - 5.2) which will allow us to constrain the true mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds in the domain of the 'weak-wind' problem. We will gain new insights into the strength and structure of the winds of low-luminosity O-type stars with broad implications in our understanding of stellar evolution, feedback, CCSN progenitors and UCHII regions.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This programme aims to obtain high S/N spectra of 16 late-type O stars using JWST/MIRI MRS. We will cover the full wavelength range from 5-28 micron using all three grating settings, SHORT (A), MEDIUM (B), and LONG (C), with the FASTR1 readout mode. We will use a 4-point dither strategy. Background observations are not necessary given that these are point sources. Our sample covers a range in K-band magnitude from 2.6 to 8.8 mag.
