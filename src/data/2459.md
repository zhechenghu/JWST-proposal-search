## ABSTRACT

We propose to observe a carefully selected sample of 9 stars in the Milky Way with the NIRCam Grism Time Series mode and the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph to measure dust extinction curves from 2.4 to 28 micron. The continuum extinction will provide a measurement of the dust grain size distribution, while the absorption features in the extinction curve reveal details about the chemical composition of the dust grains. Combining these near- and mid-infrared extinction curves with UV extinction curves, depletion measurements and molecular hydrogen fractions, will place much stronger constraints on the grain composition and its variation between sightlines than could ever be derived from these individual measurements. The proposed observations are currently the last missing piece to complete the puzzle.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose to observe 9 Milky Way stars with the NIRCam Grism Time Series mode and the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph to measure dust extinction curves from 2.4 to 28 micron. These stars have been carefully selected from a larger sample for which UV extinction curves, H2-fractions and depletion measurements of C, Si, Mg, Fe and O are (or will be) available. Only stars that do no show evidence for strong stellar winds were included in the sample, based on their IRS spectra and/or IR colors. The NIRCam Grism Time Series mode allows short enough integration times to take spectra of our bright targets without saturating the detector. These observations (in filter F322W2) will provide the continuum extinction between 2.4 and 4.2 micron, and will allow us to distinguish substructure in the HAC feature at 3.4 micron. With the MIRI MRS we will be able to measure the continuum extinction between 5 and 28 micron, and to study the profile of the 10 micron silicate feature in detail, and detect small shifts in its peak wavelength and variations in its width between different sightlines. We request a total of 17 hours for these observations.
