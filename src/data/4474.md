## ABSTRACT

Dark exposures are taken in the different science sub-arrays to produce the pipeline reference files for these read-out patterns. There are 4 sets of observations with 3 months between sets.
This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request time to take a series of NIRISS sub-array darks in parallel to monitor the characteristics of the NIRISS detector in the science sub-arrays. Analysis of the observations will provide measurements of the dark signal, the specific noise properties in these configurations, and the bad pixels in the array. The observations will be used to update the pipeline dark reference files as needed.
Observations 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and 16 to 20 constitute the four sets of observations. Each set has a nominal 1 month window, separated by a gap of 2 months. If the observations cannot be scheduled in the 1 month window then they can be rescheduled in the 2 month gap.
