## ABSTRACT

To understand how a planet forms and accretes its atmosphere, we must first detect a sample of protoplanets which are in this late stage of their formation. The presence of such protoplanets is readily inferred with high spatial and spectral resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, revealing the characteristic kinematic signatures associated with embedded, giant protoplanets. Forward modeling of these hydrodynamic features yields robust constraints on the locations and masses of the perturbing protoplanets, providing a sample which represents the best opportunity to study the process of atmospheric accretion. We have selected the four most promising sources to observe with MIRI to: (1) confirm the planetary nature of the kinematic features observed at sub-mm wavelengths, and (2) place initial constraints on the luminosity of the protoplanets. These goals are the critical first steps in developing comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up observations of these protoplanets. Extensive modeling has demonstrated that coronographic observations at 11.4 um with JWST/MIRI allow for the most sensitive searches for such objects, balancing the intrinsic wavelength-dependent brightness of the young protoplanets with the expected extinction from surrounding disk material. At these mid infrared wavelengths, space-based observations are essential for these goals owing to the stability and sensitivity unachievable by ground-based facilities.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

In this program we aim to directly image 4 protoplanet candidates embedded in protoplanetary disks (RXJ1615.3-3255, RXJ1842.9-3532, LkCa 15, SY Cha) that show clear evidence for planet-disk interactions, both in the disk structure and gas kinematics. Thanks to clear deviations observed in the kinematics of the 12CO emission line observed with ALMA, these planets are identified at locations between 0.8" and 1.8", well within reach of JWST. To observe these planets, we will use JWST/MIRI in the F1140C filter with the 4QPM coronagraph, and will observe a reference star to perform reference differential imaging (RDI). The reference star will be dithered using a 9-point-dither to increase the diversity of our PSF library at close separations. A background observation will be taken for each source to mitigate the effect referred to as 'glowing stick'.
We will reduce our data using the JWST pipeline and perform starlight subtraction using pyKLIP following the Direct Imaging ERS program. We will assess the statistical significance of our detections using the FMMF routines built in pyKLIP. Astrometry and photometry of our detected protoplanets will be estimated using the BKA module of pyKLIP.
The photometric detection of the protoplanets will be combined to constraints from ALMA gas observations, to provide the first fundamental step in assessing the mass-luminosity relationship of protoplanets, and thus set urgently needed constraints to the theories of planet formation
