## ABSTRACT

The origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) remains a mystery, despite many years of observational and theoretical work. While many star-forming regions within ~2.5 kpc of the Sun have been studied, quite whether there is a single form of the IMF across the Milky Way, from the dense clusters near the Galactic Cluster to the low metallicity outer reaches of the galaxy, leads to one of the key questions – what is the effect of environment? But studying young, dense stellar clusters at large distances is challenging, requiring high spatial resolution to separate the many objects across a reasonably-sized field to cover a whole cluster, and high sensitivity to extend as far down the mass function into the sub-stellar regime as possible. The capabilities of JWST present a huge step forward in all regards.

Sharpless 2-305 (henceforth S305) is a relatively poorly studied, high-mass star-forming region (age ~ 2Myr) in the outer Galaxy (D ~ 5.1 kpc, Rgal ~ 12.2 kpc) containing OB stars and with an estimated stellar mass of ~3000 solar masses. The outer Galaxy has different physical properties from regions interior to the Sun, including lower metallicity, which are thought to affect star formation, perhaps leading to a steeper IMF. Broad-band near-infrared imaging of S305 with the VLT has revealed a dense embedded cluster covering a few square arcminutes, surrounded by a classical HII region with bright ionised gas, dust, and a number of embedded smaller clusters nearby, potentially younger. There is also a large reflection nebula nearby that appears to be illuminated by a deeply embedded source that is very bright in the mid- to far-infrared – this may be a new massive star whose formation has been triggered by the expanding HII region.
Thus we will carry out a NIRCam survey in Cycle 3 of S305 and its environs, including the possible massive protostar candidate. This will involve a set of 7 medium- and broad-band filters spanning the whole NIRCam wavelength range, optimised to detect and characterise stars across the stellar IMF and substellar young brown dwarfs through H2O absorption down to 10–15MJup, also allowing the dust absorption in the region and the infrared excess emission from circumstellar disks to be assessed and accounted for. One narrow-band filterr will be used to search for evidence of jets and outflows from the embedded objects.

The mosaic will be centred between the main HII region and cluster, and the younger reflection nebula to the SE.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) remains a mystery, despite many years of observational and theoretical work. While many star-forming regions within ~2.5 kpc of the Sun have been studied, quite whether there is a single form of the IMF across the Milky Way, from the dense clusters near the Galactic Cluster to the low metallicity outer reaches of the galaxy, leads to one of the key questions – what is the effect of environment? But studying young, dense stellar clusters at large distances is challenging, requiring high spatial resolution to separate the many objects across a reasonably-sized field to cover a whole cluster, and high sensitivity to extend as far down the mass function into the sub-stellar regime as possible. The capabilities of JWST present a huge step forward in all regards.

Sharpless 2-305 (henceforth S305) is a relatively poorly studied, high-mass star-forming region (age ~ 2Myr) in the outer Galaxy (D ~ 5.1 kpc, Rgal ~ 12.2 kpc) containing OB stars and with an estimated stellar mass of ~3000 solar masses. The outer Galaxy has different physical properties from regions interior to the Sun, including lower metallicity, which are thought to affect star formation, perhaps leading to a steeper IMF. Broad-band near-infrared imaging of S305 with the VLT has revealed a dense embedded cluster covering a few square arcminutes, surrounded by a classical HII region with bright ionised gas, dust, and a number of embedded smaller clusters nearby, potentially younger. There is also a large reflection nebula nearby that appears to be illuminated by a deeply embedded source that is very bright in the mid- to far-infrared – this may be a new massive star whose formation has been triggered by the expanding HII region.

Thus we will carry out a NIRCam survey in Cycle 3 of S305 and its environs, including the possible massive protostar candidate. This will involve a set of 6 medium- and broad-band filters spanning the whole NIRCam wavelength range, optimised to detect and characterise stars across the stellar IMF and substellar young brown dwarfs through H2O absorption down to 10–15MJup, also allowing the dust absorption in the region and the infrared excess emission from circumstellar disks to be assessed and accounted for. A further 2 narrow-band filters will be used to search for evidence of jets and outflows from the embedded objects.

The mosaic will be centred between the main HII region and cluster, and the younger reflection nebula to the SE.
