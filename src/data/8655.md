## OBSERVATIONS TABLE

    The requested "OBSERVATIONS" table, which should contain the List of Labels, Observing Template, and Science Targets, is **not present** in the provided images. The "OBSERVATIONS" section is a heading on page 1, but no table follows it in the given content.

## ABSTRACT
    Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star (WC) plus O-star binaries are copious dust producers, with the binary WR 140 being the canonical example of episodic dust-generators. Early Release Science observations using JWST/MIRI/MRS of WR 140 have provided unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution of not only the dust structure surrounding the binary, but also the gaseous wind structures whose collisions form the dust. This system is therefore ripe for a dynamic modeling effort to use both the dust and gas diagnostics to constrain how the collision of the stellar winds produces dust. We will undertake hydrodynamic simulations of the colliding winds of WR 140 and then produce radiative transfer calculations on the output in order to directly compare the models with the MRS observables, all while iterating on the model parameters in order to improve the model-to-observation agreement. We will also synthesize the X-ray emission from the hydrodynamic simulations to compare against the many observations with NASA's X-ray fleet, thereby constraining WR 140's full shock structure -- from the apex of the wind-wind collision region directly between the stars to the much larger dust-enriched region -- simultaneously. The end result will be improved constraints on how this important class of objects generates dust, such as grain size, nucleation radius, temperature, and composition.
