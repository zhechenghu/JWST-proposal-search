## ABSTRACT
    Ultracool white dwarfs (WDs) display peculiar energy distributions with very strong collision-induced absorption (CIA) features in the infrared. They are generally thought to be among the coolest, oldest WDs of our Galaxy, and therefore crucial objects for WD cosmochronology. Despite their importance, the very nature of ultracool WDs remains unknown. Some model atmosphere analyses suggest that they have extremely low temperatures and masses (Teff~3500K, M~0.2Msun) while others suggest more moderate temperatures and normal masses (Teff~4500K, M~0.6Msun), implying multi-Gyr discrepancies for their inferred ages. The key difference between these widely diverging assessments is the choice of CIA opacities. JWST can decidedly settle this debate by directly revealing CIA features for the first time through infrared spectroscopy of ultracool WDs. We propose to use NIRSpec and MIRI to obtain low-resolution spectroscopy of three ultracool WDs that we selected for their unique potential to yield the most stringent constraints on competing models.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
    We will observe 3 WDs within 40 pc of the Sun, with precise positions, parallaxes, and proper motions from Gaia DR3. We will use NIRSpec Prism and MIRI LRS to obtain low-resolution spectroscopy from 0.6 to 12 microns. Observations for each target can be split; this would not impact our science goals.
