## ABSTRACT

The protostellar stage is a critical phase in stellar evolution: the star is still being built up, and a rotating disk of gas and dust is being formed, setting the scene for new solar systems. Observations and models suggest that planet formation starts early, in the embedded phase of star formation, <0.5 Myr after cloud collapse. The main goal of this program is to use the unique capabilities of the MIRI-MRS to characterize the physical and chemical content of the inner (<10 au) warm planet-forming zones of 21 protostellar Class I disks with known host protostellar mass and to compare the results with those found from gas-phase lines in widely studied disks in the Class II stage. Since the effects of radial drift of icy grains enriching the inner disks and dust traps locking up elements in the outer disk are minimized at early times, these young disks should provide the best view of the pristine chemical conditions and bulk elemental abundances in planet-forming zones. The specific goals of this program are (i) to measure the warm gas composition of young disks which only MIRI can detect, especially of H2O, CO2, and organics (C2H2 and HCN) and thereby also elemental abundance ratios; (ii) to compare this composition with those of more evolved Class II disks; (iii) to link those comparisons to effects of (species-dependent) radial drift timescales and dust traps. This study will impact both the immediate sub-field of protoplanetary disks by showing the most detailed composition of young disks to date, as well as broader planet formation and exoplanetary characterization fields by revealing the starting chemical mixture for forming planets.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Observations of 21 Class I protoplanetary disks with MIRI MRS full spectral coverage. The observations are taken with a single pointing centered on a protostar, with 4-dither point source pattern. For each group of targets a sky background is obtained and targets are grouped in an uninterruptible sequence.
