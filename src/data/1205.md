## ABSTRACT

Attempts to image the hosts of very high redshift quasars have been frustratingly difficult. What detections there are have been made in the near infrared, i.e., rest frame ultraviolet. Hence, it is difficult to interpret the results: a small amount of very recent star formation could dominate the signals. Nonetheless, the limits have raised the question of whether the local Magorrian relation holds this early in galaxy evolution. Dynamical masses from the 157 micron [CII] line, indicate a roughly normal (i.e., Magorrian) ratio of total mass to black hole mass (but of course, with no measure of the relative mass in dark matter, stars, and gas). In this program (ID 1205), we will use a combination of IFU spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging to search much more deeply and definitively for host galaxies around five high redshift AGNs.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The goal of this program is to examine in detail the stellar content of AGN host galaxies at high redshift, to test whether the co-evolution of stars and black holes is in place by z = 5 - 7. We have selected six quasars to test a variety of ways to detect their host galaxies. J073103.12+445949.4 and J134015.03+392630.7 are at z ~ 5, which places their Balmer breaks (if they have them) optimally in the NIRSpec medium wavelength range. They also have very massive black holes and large dynamical masses. We will obtain both NIRCam images and very high signal to noise NIRSpec spectra of them, the latter to see if we can detect host galaxies even if they hide behind the quasar psf in the images. J2239+0207 is a sub-Eddington quasar with a massive black hole and large dynamical mass; our estimates are that the host galaxy might account for as much as 10% of the integrated light near 0.5 microns rest. We will search for it in both imaging and a prism NIRSpec spectrum (this strategy is dictated because it is too faint for higher spectral resolution at reasonable signal to noise). SDSS J1148+5251 and ULAS J112001.48+064124.3 are among the highest redshift quasars known, very thoroughly studied, and again with very massive black holes and high dynamical masses. We will obtain images of them but not spectra (since their Balmer breaks are not placed advantageously spectrally). In addition, we will image the z = 5.72 radio galaxy TGSS J1530+1049 to test whether its continuum shows a Balmer break and if so to estimate its strength, and thus to determine to what extent it falls off the usual relation between luminous radio galaxies and the stellar masses of their host galaxies.
