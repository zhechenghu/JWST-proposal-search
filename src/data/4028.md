## ABSTRACT

We propose NIRSpec IFU and MIRI LRS observations of eight of Jupiter's irregular satellites. These satellites are thought to be captured during planetary migration from regions beyond Jupiter's formation location, but poor understanding of their compositions limits understanding of their origins. Our proposed spectroscopic observations will test a key prediction of planetary migration models: that Jovian irregular satellites were sourced from the same parent population as Jovian Trojans and dark, organic-rich main belt asteroids. By acquiring spectroscopic measurements of Jovian irregular satellites, this program will determine whether their compositions are consistent with this shared-capture scenario. This data set will also test whether material ejected from irregular satellite collisions is implanted onto the Galilean satellites, constraining a possible key source of organic-rich material within the Jovian system.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The proposed observations target 8 of the irregular satellites of Jupiter, orbiting beyond Callisto. We propose the use of the NIRSpec instrument in its IFU Prism mode and MIRI LRS measurements for each object. As Solar System objects, they all vary in brightness by roughly 0.4 magnitudes over the course of Cycle 2 as their viewing geometry changes. The exposure times included in this proposal assume these objects are observed at their faintest. We note that all objects are more than 600 arcseconds from the limb of Jupiter at all times during Cycle 2 when they are within the JWST field of regard, except for Sinope. For comparison, we note that Callisto reaches a maximum of 595 arcseconds from Jupiter's limb and Europa reaches a maximum of 200 arcseconds from Jupiter's limb. Sinope is less than 200 arcseconds from Jupiter's limb for a total of 6 days, all in the first observing window of Cycle 2, and has a period of roughly 20 days in that window when it is closer than 600 arcseconds. We have not added any additional timing constraints for Sinope. The groups, integration time, etc. are all designed to return SNR > 100 near 4 micrometers with NIRSpec and with MIRI near 6 micrometers for all objects except Themisto, for which we target SNR = 100 near 3 micrometers and SNR ~ 200 near 10 micrometers.
