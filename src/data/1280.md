## ABSTRACT

We plan to characterize the atmosphere (molecular content, hazes, pressure - temperature profile) of WASP-107 b, an exoplanet in the transition region between the gas giants and ice giants by observing spectroscopically the star light transmitted through the atmosphere during a transit of the exoplanet in front of its host star.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We want to observe a transit of the WASP107-b exoplanet with MIRI in the Slitless Low Resolution Spectroscopic mode.
The observations have to be done as time-series.
The observations are time constrained; they have to start phased for transit of the exoplanet.
We do not allow for parallel observations given the high level of stability required.
