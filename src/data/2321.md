## ABSTRACT

We propose to use NIRCam's narrow-band filters to observe a 65 sq. arcmin mosaic in the well-studied COSMOS-CANDELS field, to identify and study ~1000 emission-line selected galaxies across cosmic time. Our primary science driver is the detection of ~40 H-alpha emitters at redshift z>6, using difference imaging between the closely-spaced F466N and F470N filters. The H-alpha emission line is the best-calibrated star-formation indicator in the nearby Universe, and narrow-band surveys have mapped the evolution of H-alpha emitters out to the peak star-formation epoch at z~2. At higher redshift, samples of star-forming galaxies and estimates of the cosmic star-formation rate density are almost ubiquitously based on rest-frame UV observations; this single approach carries a high risk of systematic effects, both in the populations of galaxies selected and in their derived properties. Our proposal will provide the first critical test of this, producing a clean, emission-line selected sample of galaxies in to the Epoch of Reionisation, whose properties will be characterised and compared against UV-selected samples. Simultaneous imaging with the F212N and F200W filters will detect ~200 faint H-alpha emitters at cosmic noon, z~2, probing a factor 5 deeper than any previous study. Using NIRCam's remarkable angular resolution we will measure the ionised gas structures of these galaxies (and hundreds of other line-emitters at z>1.5, including ~10 [OIII] emitters at z=8.3) at sub-kpc resolution and determine how the relationship between UV and ionised gas structures varies with host galaxy properties, in order to delineate the physical processes driving star formation at these redshifts.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This project is concerned with narrow-band imaging of a ~65 square arcmin mosaic in the COSMOS-CANDELS field, using two filter combinations (for difference imaging to detect emission line galaxies). In the long-band, filters F466N and F470N are used. Simultaneously, F212N and F200W are used in the short-band.
The observations are built from a 3x3 mosaic, with 57% column overlaps and 5% row overlaps to ensure a compact contiguous coverage. At each location, 3-point intramodule dithering is used to fill intrachip gaps in the short-band and assist with removal of bad pixels and cosmic rays. The MEDIUM8 strategy (with 9 or 10 groups) is adopted, which gives a data rate well within limits. Overall, this results in an on-sky integration time of around 6000s over the full mosaic, and a factor ~2 longer in the central 40% of the mosaic. The programme is split into two separate observations (F470N with F212N, and F466N with F200W) in order to reduce the required number of filter changes (as requested for NIRCam - although this increases overheads by a few percent).
Matched coverage is essential, so the observations are constrained to the same on-sky position angle. COSMOS has two visibility windows during Cycle 1. Within each window, the telescope roll angle varies only slowly. It changes by around 180 degrees between the two windows. We limit the on-sky position angle to lie between 105 and 293 degrees. In practice this limits the angle to between 105 and 115 degrees in the April-June 2022 visibility window, and to between 285 and 293 degrees in the Nov 2022 to Jan 2023 window. This restriction introduces no additional scheduling constraints, but ensures that in either case the mosaic remains within the existing ACS+WFC3 coverage.
