## ABSTRACT

We propose to observe SMACS 0723 with NIRISS WFSS in the F150W filter to complete the Early Release Observations (EROs) of the field. The current NIRISS WFSS EROs are limited to the F115W and F200W only, missing the F150W middle filter. The proposed F150W observations will enable a wealth of science (currently not achievable with the limited F115W and F200W coverage) for the z=0.39 cluster galaxies and for background sources, including the first detailed spatially-resolved NIRISS spectroscopic study of an exceptional, highly-magnified cluster at cosmic noon. The proposed observations will ensure the long lasting legacy value of the NIRISS EROs of Webb's First Deep Field, and we therefore waive any proprietary time for a direct access of this data by the community.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request observing the SMACS 0723 cluster with NIRISS in WFSS mode using the two orthogonal grisms (G150R and G150C) with the F150W filter. To maximize the fraction of traces dispersed on the detector for our primary targets of interest in the field, we require a V3 PA range between 235 and 245 degrees.
