## ABSTRACT

Estimate the flux contribution of the background in TSO (Time-Series Observations) taken at the celestial pole and celestial equator. NIRISS/SOSS TSO observations of transiting exoplanets obtained during commissioning and Cycle 1 have demonstrated that the background contribution to these observations is significant.
The aim of this program is to take measurements of the zodiacal light background in the CLEAR/PRISM and F290LP/G395H configurations at two pointings, one near the ecliptic and one near the north ecliptic pole, to determine the level of variability of the background for the S1600A1 aperture for these modes.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Analysis of NIRSpec TSO data by Nestor Espinoza has shown that for some NIRSpec dispersers (e.g. PRISM and G395M/H) the background in the S1600A1 aperture can be important for some science targets and needs to be taken into account in order to obtain correct transit spectra, in particular at longer wavelengths. Therefore, we request time to observe the background through the S1600A1 aperture at two different pointings (maximum and near minimum expected Zodi) with the dispersers mentioned above. These observations will provide samples of the zodiacal light background shape in these dispersers and allow us perform further assessment and modelling of these backgrounds to correct for in NIRSpec BOTS data.
