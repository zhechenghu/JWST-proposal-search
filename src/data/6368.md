## ABSTRACT

JWST provides transformational new capabilities for surveying galaxy evolution during the early phases of cosmic history. Multi-band imaging with NIRCam is revealing an unexpectedly bright population of galaxy candidates at z > 9.5, more abundant than most theoretical models had predicted. NIRCam also images a richly diverse population of galaxies at 4 < z < 9.5 at rest-frame optical wavelengths that can be observed by HST only at z < 3. Spectroscopy with NIRSpec is the essential next step beyond imaging to confirm the most distant galaxy candidates, to determine accurate redshifts needed to robustly quantify galaxy statistics and map large scale structure, to measure physical conditions of the interstellar medium and detailed stellar population properties, and to diagnose the history of reionization using direct measurements of the Lyman alpha damping wing and its evolution. Our proposed CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) will obtain deep NIRSpec prism observations to confirm or refute more than 100 z > 9.5 galaxy candidates identified in three wide-field public NIRCam survey fields from CEERS and PRIMER, while also measuring redshifts for approximately 2000 galaxies selected by NIRCam imaging of optical rest-frame light at 4 < z < 9.5, and 10000 galaxies at all redshifts. CAPERS will build a spectroscopic legacy data set that will serve as a resource for studying galaxy evolution and as a foundation for further, future detailed spectroscopy with JWST's NIRSpec and MIRI and with millimeter and radio observatories.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The observations proposed consist of 21 NIRSpec MSA pointings distributed to cover a large fraction of the NIRCam imaging from the CEERS and PRIMER public surveys in the EGS, COSMOS and UDS fields. The prism was selected as the best option to both maximize the number of observed targets and measure the continuum of faint z > 9.5 galaxies whose strongest emission lines are redshifted beyond the NIRSpec wavelength coverage. The exposure times selected allow the detection of the continuum emission and the identification of the Lyman break for faint z > 9.5 sources as faint as F277W~28 AB.

We have optimized our NIRSpec MSA pointing strategy to maximize coverage of the NIRCam survey fields, minimize MSA area outside NIRCam, and most importantly to maximize coverage of the top-priority z > 9.5 galaxy targets. COSMOS and UDS have low ecliptic latitudes, and therefore high seasonal variability of zodical background, which can substantially impact the background noise for NIRSpec prism data. We choose scheduling windows such that the 4.4 micron background is <0.3 MJy/sr (comparable to higher-latitude fields like CEERS/EGS), obeying micrometeroid avoidance restrictions. Those windows are Apr 5 to May 24 for COSMOS and Dec 4 to Jan 25 for the UDS. Efficient MSA tiling of CEERS and maximum yield for z > 9.6 candidates lead to an implicit Special Requirement for Aperture Position Angle (APA) = 0 (V3PA = 221.5), which is schedulable outside the micrometeroid avoidance zone.

Each MSA configuration will be observed for an exposure time of 6040s with a 3-shutter nodding pattern. The MSA will be reconfigured three times, with the faint z > 9.5 targets kept in open shutters and other targets swapped to maximize the total yield of targets at z < 9.5.

For each individual MSA pointing, a range of available PAs and possitions are tested with the eMPT tool. From the best eMPT solutions, final MSA configurations are refined in MPT. Each pointing is observed with three different configurations, only repeating the z > 9.5 targets. For proposal optimization purposes, we have used catalogs including objects at high-z with NIRCam observations, so the total number of sources observed in these plans are not final and they will increase to ~150 targets per MSA configuration when lower redshift sources (and some HST-selected sources in CEERS) are included in the MPT input catalogs.

For those pointings where the NIRCam parallels fall out of the CEERS and PRIMER NIRCam imaging, we observe with the F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W and F444W broad bands employed in those surveys to extend the observations of the fields. In the cases where the parallels overlap the current NIRCam coverage, we will employ the F140M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F335M and F480M medium bands, which, combined with the available broad band data, will be extremely useful for more finely sample galaxy SEDs to detect and measure breaks (Balmer and Lyman alpha) and high-EW emission lines, while also improving photo-z and stellar population parameter estimates for galaxies falling within the medium-band regions.

Chronology of updates and resubmissions:

APT resubmission for UDS observations (December 2024-January 2025): NIRSpec use two cycles of 3-shutter nods, with total exposure time 2 x 2888.6s. For UDS_P1, P2 and P3, we include cross-dispersion dithers of +/- 0.1 shutters =~ +/- 0.5 pixels between the two nodding sequences as a test. UDS_P4, P5, P6 and P7 are not dithered. Each MSA configuration is a separate observation.

In practice, many of the UDS observations in January 2025 were skipped, mostly due to the shutdown of JPL for the Eaton Fire of January 2025. It is expected that they will be rescheduled.

APT resubmission for CEERS observations (March 2025): The observation structure was changed to group the three MSA configurations at each pointing into a single observation. We include small cross-dispersion dithers (as described above) for observations CEERS_P1, P3 and P5, leaving the others undithered, in order to compare the impact of this dither on data reduction and data product quality.

Observation 60 for CEERS_P6 experienced an FGS failure. A new observation 65 was created to repeat P6 at a different APA. New MSA plans were generated, and APT was submitted with the updated observation 65 on 8 May 2025.

APT resubmission for COSMOS observations (April-May 2025): The observation structure matches that for CEERS (above), i.e., the three MSA configuration at each pointing are grouped into a single observation. No cross-dispersion dithers are used for these observations.
