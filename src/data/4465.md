## ABSTRACT

Sample the slit losses for the MSA shutters in the 1x1 and 1x3 shutter case at any given position of the shutter. The observations conducted during commissioning didn't sufficiently sample the corners of the MSA shutter, thus an accurate and smooth slit loss calibration could not be produced. We will add extra slit losses measurement for MOS at the corners of one shutter.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.
