## ABSTRACT

We will observe four dwarf spheroidal companions of the Andromeda Galaxy M31, to determine their bulk PMs. The targets, And I, III, XIV, and XVII, are believed to be members of a satellite plane. Their PMs will resolve whether this plane is a physical structure, which would have important cosmological implications, or merely a chance superposition. PMs will be determined either from comparison to existing HST data, or from comparison to similar JWST observations to be obtained in GTO Cycles 2 and 3, or to be requested in future JWST GO cycles.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will image four satellites galaxies of M31 with NIRCAM using the F200W+F277W filters. We will also obtain parallel field images with NIRISS with F200W.

We request that the observations be obtained prior to Sep 1, 2023. This is important to optimize the time baseline, and hence proper motion accuracy, compared to our other past/planned JWST observations of this field.
