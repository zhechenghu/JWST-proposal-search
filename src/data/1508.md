## ABSTRACT
A high S/N observation of a single star will be taken in the three medium-band NIRISS AMI filters. These observations will be used to determine the AMI closure phases. This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
A long observation of a known single star will be taken in the three NIRISS/AMI medium-band filters to provide a high S/N measurement of the closure phases. This only needs to be done for one star but three stars are included in the program to provide one target visible at any time. These targets are all PSF reference stars, so no linkage of the observations is required.
