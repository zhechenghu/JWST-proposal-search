## ABSTRACT

This program provides additonal data for the MOS S-flat (spectroscopic flat field) reference files. The MOS S-flat is a cube with complete but sparse sampling in wavelength space per pixel. This allows the calibration of MOS spectra, regardless of the location of the MSA shutters used. Data will be obtained through 20 MSA long slit configurations using the CAA internal calibration FLAT lamps to expand the wavelength interpolation of the S-flat. The S-flat is one part of the 3 component NIRSpec flat field: the F-flat traces the field-dependent throughput of the OTE and instrument FORE optics, the S-flat traces the light path from the micro-shutter array up to but not including the FPA and the D-flat consists of the pixel-to-pixel variations of the detector.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This spectroscopic flats program executes 20 MOS long slit flat observations to improve the wavelength interpolation of the MOS spectroscopic flats of which 36 long slits were taken during commissioning and provide complete but sparse coverage of the possible shutter configurations.

The internal CAA will be used to provide the appropriate flat illumination (FLATx lamps) for each of the seven dispersers (with the filter wheel at the OPAQUE position). For every disperser the MSA will be configured to the 20 long slits. Without moving the GWA a set of IFU exposures (MSA ALLCLOSED and IFU aperture open, to obtain the leakage correction) will also be taken.

The execution sequence for this activity, 1) minimizes mechanism usage, and 2) complies with GWA rule for leakage exposures and 3) attempts to minimize execution time by scheduling during slews, even though this dramatically increases over head time.

Sequence details:
-divide the 20 long slits configurations into five scheduling blocks of four long slits each
-for each block cycle through the disperser configurations
-for each disperser position cycle through the four long slits in that block

The exposures within each of the five observation folders are for 4 of the 20 long slits and cycle through the 9 flat lamp/ grating combinations. 2 long slits (and the corresponding IFU) are scheduled in each visit.

All MSA long slit configurations will need to be updated after the commissioning data are executed and analyzed to optimize placement across the detectors.
