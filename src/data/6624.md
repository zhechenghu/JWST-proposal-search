## ABSTRACT

New to APT v2024.1 is the ability to perform target acquisition on a separate target with MIRI coronagraphy. This program performs a simple test to confirm the planning and scheduling software correctly computes the required slews, and the telescope is correctly commanded.
This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Two observations using the new Offset TA tool. One observation of HD 167855 A with B selected as the TA star, and one observation of HD 167855 B with A selected as the TA star.
