## ABSTRACT

The evolution of planetary atmospheres is an essential component in the characterisation of exoplanets, as well as developing an understanding of the scope of habitability within the universe. An important factor in this is atmospheric loss into space. While these loss processes are relatively well-understood at Earth, discrepancies at other planets demonstrate that there are a wide range of conditions that we don't fully understand. Jupiter represents the best possible planet to compare and contrast upper atmospheric processes, with both ongoing and upcoming spacecraft, and as an end-member as far from Earth in the range of possible exoplanets.

Here, we propose to scan the limb of Jupiter using the NIRspec-IFU, revealing the energy distribution throughout the atmosphere at that time in both altitude and latitude. These will be taken coincident to Juno radio occultation measurements: the direct comparison between JWST and Juno measurements of ionospheric emission and electron density respectively not only provides context to the specific Juno observations on that day, but also provides a unique key that helps to understand the hundreds of highly variable past occultations taken at both Jupiter and Saturn.

In combining JWST and Juno data, we will constrain the highly variable electron measurements for the first time, and provide a broader ionospheric context, highlighting waves moving both altitudinally and latitudinally. In turn, this will help reveal the primary processes that transfer energy in the ionosphere and thermosphere, ultimately giving us a detailed picture of where and how Jupiter's atmosphere is lost to space.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The observations proposed here will investigate the vertical distribution of the molecular ion H3+ above the limb of Jupiter. The F290LP/G395H filter grating combination provides coverage between 3 and 5 microns where a large number of H3+ emission lines are located. From spectral analasys of these the vertial temeprature and ion density structure can be derived.

Each position on the planet is set up as an individual target, using the torus Level 2 target description. Each observation is defined as an angle from the central meridian and a latitude, as well as a distance in km from the centre of the target. The exposure of the first tile will be coordinated with Juno radio occultations of the atmopshere, which provides a measure of the vertical electron density, which will be measured simultaneously with the ion (H3+) component. After this tile, the sequence of observations will move anti-clockwise along the limb of the planet, capturing emissions at all latitudes for a global picture of the ionopshere. A total of 34 individual tiles make up this set of observations.
