## ABSTRACT

We aim to obtain NIRSpec/IFU observations of free floating planetary mass objects in young moving group associations to serve as analogs for directly imaged planetary mass companions in the same groups and associations. The observations will allow us to make direct comparisons between objects of the same age, mass and effective temperature, but which may have formed through varying formation mechanisms and experienced different evolution. The observed objects will serve as important benchmarks for characterizing directly imaged exoplanets.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We have selected two free floating analogs to directly imaged gaseous planets in the AB Dor moving group and Upper-Scorpius region. The observations are adjusted to have similar sensitivity and signal to noise as their corresponding exoplanet-counterpart.
