## ABSTRACT

This activity is needed to verify and trend the behavior of the two NIRSpec wheel mechanisms (FWA and GWA). Pending any unexpected behavior, the GWA characterization will be done twice during Cycle 2 (in August and in October) in order to maintain the agreed bi-weekly cadence. The FWA characterization will only be done once (in October). The procedure collects NIRSpec-focused telemetry data in the HC buffer at each commanded wheel position, and sends them to the ground for inspection after the procedure is completed. A series of mechanism move commands will be issued to step the FWA/GWA one position at a time through all 8 wheel positions, in both the forward and reverse directions. At each position, the HC buffer is armed before a move and then dumped after the move. The procedure acquires internal calibrations with NIRSpec as the prime instrument, and takes approximately 1 hour to execute for each mechanism.
Mandatory caveat: This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.
