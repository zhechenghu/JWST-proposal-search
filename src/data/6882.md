## ABSTRACT

Recent discoveries of luminous galaxies to z=14.3 and numerous faint AGNs to z~10 are remarkable, prompting the next step of addressing their earlier phases to explore the first galaxies, black holes (BHs), and their evolution. However, their intrinsic faintness remains a challenge in general field surveys.

To overcome this, we propose a multi-epoch Treasury program that immediately releases uniform NIRCam 10-filter imaging (0.16deg2; 5sigma~28mag) in 60 well-studied massive clusters (epoch1) and NIRSpec/MSA follow-up spectroscopy + NIRCam 2filter imaging in the 10 best-selected clusters (epoch2). This program significantly widens JWST-observed highly-magnified areas and identifies apparently bright (thus spectroscopically feasible), but intrinsically faint distant objects >10-100x more than previous lensing cluster surveys. Naturally, this enables unique discoveries in Image/Spec/Time dimensions and initial spec census of
1) Onset of star-formation at z>14 and UV luminosity functions at z~6-20 down to Muv=-12
2) Spatially resolved characterizations and evolution histories in early galaxies down to star cluster scales
3) Low-mass BHs down to ~10^5Msun in normal galaxies and their over/under-massive relations
4) Lensed stars and supernovae at z>5-6 and test the top-heavy initial mass function

The target clusters/numbers are carefully determined to secure the key discoveries beyond the cosmic variance. A wide lensing survey must now be done to find where the community invests more time (e.g, long monitoring). We commit to immediate data release (maps, catalogs, multiple lens models) for all 60 lensing clusters, unlocking unprecedented legacy fields for the community.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

VENUS is JWSt's first wide (~0.16 deg^2, 5sigma~28mag) lensing cluster survey to unlock the apparently bright (thus spectroscopically feasible), but intrinsically faint distant objects of galaxies, AGNs, stars, and SNe at z~4-20, that are all unique laboratories to study their detailed characterizations with high-fidelity spectroscopy and approach first galaxies, BHs, and stars, mission of JWST.

The survey design consists of two key components of
A) Homogeneous NIRCam 10 filter imaging for 45 new clusters, 4-6 filter imaging for 14 NIRCam-observed clusters -> establish uniform N=60 lensing clusters with NIRCam 10 filters (Epoch1 in Cycle4)
B) NIRCam 2 filter imaging and NIRSpec/MSA prism+G395M follow-up for the best-selected 10 lensing clusters (Epoch 2 in Cycle5),
and a coordinated-parallel component of
C) NIRISS 5 filter imaging (epoch1) and NIRCam 4 filter imaging (epoch2)

Below, we describe the observation details in each epoch, including the coordinated parallel.
**** A) Epoch1: NIRCam imaging *****
Following the successful UNCOVER scheme, our design uses initial NIRCam observations as "pre-imaging" for NIRSpec follow-up, while details are further optimized to maximize the community's benefit.
We observe 45 new clusters with NIRCam 10 filters and supplements currently missing 2-4 filters for 14 previously observed clusters. For the latter, short exposures with F150W/F444W will be added, creating time-domain fields without extra slewing costs.

**** B) Epoch: NIRCam + NIRSpec ****
NIRSpec/MSA prism+G395M follow-up for priority objects in 10 clusters, while re-obtaining short exposures in F150W/F444W to gain the time-domain fields.
Together with existing data, this strategy delivers unprecedented legacy fields: uniform 60 lensing clusters with 10 filters (~0.16deg2) and time-domain lensing fields (~0.13deg2).
HST/F160W data will complement NIRCam/F150W for time domain in the 45 new cluster fields.

**** C. Coordinated-Parallel ****
Although luminous ultra-high-redshift galaxies, such as GS-z14-0 at z=14.3 are likely well-evolved and may not represent the earliest star formation epochs, they are most likely descendants of the first galaxies. Thus, further identification of GS-z14-0-like galaxies and quantification of their abundance aligns with the primary objective of this program: to study the first galaxies, stars, and black holes.
Despite the absence of lensing benefits in off-cluster fields, we capitalize on the random lines of sight provided by lensing cluster observations. This approach is crucial for mitigating cosmic variance effects. Consequently, we conduct the following coordinated parallel observations:
Epoch 1) NIRISS F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W imaging concurrent with NIRCam 10-filter imaging,
Epoch 2) NIRCam F150W, F210M, F250M, F300M imaging during NIRSpec prism+G395M spectroscopy
This strategy yields an additional 290arcmin2 survey area, enhancing our ability to constrain the bright end (mobs<28.0-28.5~mag) of the UV luminosity function at z>10-14.

NIRCam observation setup:
We use a total of 10 NIRCam filters: F090W/F115W/F150W/F200W/F210M/F277W/F300M/F356W/F410M/F444W.
The additional F210M+F300M is critical to improve the z>12 galaxy selection, descriminating the lower-z dusty line emitters, which mimics the high-z Lyman break feature.
We request ~20-30mins exposure to achieve 28mag (5sigma, point source) homogeneously in all these filters.
The same exposure time will be applied for the time-domain F150W/F444W observations.

NIRSpec MSA setup:
We request 3545 sec for both prism and G395M to achieve our goals.
Exposures will be obtained with standard 3 nod-in-slit, NRSIRS2RAPID, 80 groups/int, 1 int.
