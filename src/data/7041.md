## ABSTRACT

A key goal of JWST is to determine how galaxies evolved across cosmic time. Nebular emission lines provide our most detailed view of the properties/conditions of star-forming galaxies (SFGs). However, the robustness of these diagnostics hinges on our ability to understand the ionizing sources powering them. While the non-ionizing and low-energy ionizing continua of SFGs have been successfully mapped, the high-energy ionizing continuum (>54 eV) is completely unconstrained. This poses an alarming problem for the revolutionary high-z JWST observations that reveal inexplicably intense high-ionization emission. Progress requires constraining the high-energy ionizing continuum responsible for these lines, but, there is no feasible way to directly observe it. Fortunately, MIRI boasts 100x higher sensitivity than previous observatories, opening an unprecedented opportunity to detect rare emission lines that trace the unseen high-energy ionizing continuum.

We propose the CLASSY+IR (CLASSYIR) Treasury: MIRI spectra of 31 local SFGs to complete the 1st comprehensive investigation to map the unseen ionizing continuum shape. CLASSYIR will leverage existing datasets to provide the community with high level science products, including benchmark integrated, aperture-matched UV+optical+MIR spectral templates. The CLASSYIR templates will sensitively probe, for the 1st time, the range of ionization states needed to map the shape of the full ionizing spectra of the sources powering nebular emission across cosmic time. In tandem with JWST observations of the 1st galaxies, these templates will reveal our 1st glimpse into the ionizing sources that dominated the early universe.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

CLASSYIR will observe a diverse sample of 31 local star-forming galaxies, 25 new + 6 archival targets, with JWST/MIRI MRS spectroscopy and simultaneous imaging. The program is designed to construct the first publicly-available, high-quality, high-resolution, comprehensive, panchromatic FUV-to-MIR spectral atlas appropriate for SFGs across all redshifts.

MIRI MRS Science Exposures: Each target makes use of all three of the MIRI MRS gratings (A, B, C) to map the full MIR range (5 to 28 um). The science goals require emission line detections with S/N>5 per resolution element at moderate resolutions in order to trace features across the surface of our targets and resolve the blended components of complex features. We require very high sensitivity in order to detect the range of emission features covered by MIRI over the surface of the CLASSYIR galaxies. Given the large range of galaxy parameters spanned by the CLASSYIR sample, exposure times were based on the intermediate-ionization [ArIII] 8.99m emission line, and assuming a 2D Gaussian flux distribution over a radius of 1.5" (to match the aperture of the integrated optical fluxes).

MIRI MRS Background: Due to the extended nature of the CLASSYIR targets, we have included dedicated background MRS observations, with exposures matched to half of the science exposure times. These exposures will be used to create master dark frames to mitigate the MIR thermal background signatures. Background fields are chosen to cover blank portions of the sky (confirmed via WISE, DSS, and GALEX imaging, where available), while simultaneously placing the target within the MIRI imaging FoV. As such, we require an orient restriction for the background observations to match the PA of the science observations. We couple target and background observations in a non-uninterruptible sequence at fixed position angle.

Imaging Exposures: The MIRI imager will be used simultaneously with each of the MRS background observations, mapping the extended emission of the target and environment during the background MRS exposure. Imaging will be performed in three bands: F770W, F1130W/F1280 and F1800W, corresponding to one per MRS grating setting.

Target Acquisitions: Target acquisitions are not used within this program. This is because the CLASSYIR sample has excellent input coordinates from previous HST/COS target acquisition images, and 0.10" positional uncertainty tolerance.
