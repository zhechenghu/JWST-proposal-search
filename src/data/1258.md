## ABSTRACT

We will carry out NIRCam imaging covering the highly-symmetric young outflow HH212 over a field of ~6.1 arcmin x 3.5 arcmin. In shocked H2, the jet is ~4 arcmin long. We will take images in six filters: two lines of shocked molecular hydrogen (v=1–0 S(1) at 2.12 microns, F212N; v=0–0 S(9) at 4.69 microns, F470N) & corresponding line+continuum filters (F210M & F460M), one line of CO (F466N), & one intermediate wavelength which includes another shocked H2 line & continuum (v=1-0 S(0) at 3.23 microns, F335M).

Since our discovery of the jet in 1994, we have been conducting a variety of near-infrared and millimetre studies, and the JWST data will advance this work in four key ways:

First, the spatial resolution in the 2.12 micron line images will be ~5 x better than our best ground-based data (seeing limited at ~0.3”), and thus allow us to resolve small-scale shock details throughout the flow, from the inner knots to the large outer bowshocks.
Second, the 2022 date of the observations will add a further 15 years to the long baseline proper motion study (the last detailed VLT imaging was in 2007), and thus roughly double the precision and lower the detection threshold of the measurements of plane-of-the sky motions in the outflow.
Third, the complementary LW imaging in the H2 line at 4.69 micron will give a direct indication of the extinction in the flow by comparison with the 2.12 micron line: assuming an excitation temperature of ~2000K, the 2.12 micron/4.69 micron line ratio should be ~3, although extinction may make the ratio smaller. The larger LW pixels will also help bring the effective sensitivities closer together.
Four, to test for CO emission in the outflow.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will carry out NIRCam imaging covering the highly-symmetric young outflow HH212 over a field of ~6.1 arcmin x 3.5 arcmin. In shocked H2, the jet is ~4 arcmin long. We will take images in six filters: two lines of shocked molecular hydrogen (v=1–0 S(1) at 2.12 microns, F212N; v=0–0 S(9) at 4.69 microns, F470N) & corresponding line+continuum filters (F210M & F460M), one line of CO (F466N), & one intermediate wavelength which includes another shocked H2 line & continuum (v=1-0 S(0) at 3.23 microns, F335M).

HH212 is an elongated protostellar outflow roughly 4 arcmin long, aligned at a PA of roughly 22 degrees E of N. It is symmetric in the inner parts, but there is one additional large bowshock to the SW. Hence the nominal mosaic centre is offset with respect to the central protostar to ensure that the whole jet is covered.

The aim is to make a full-covered mosaic of the jet in eight filters (SW: F201M, F212N, F212N, F164N; LW: F335M, F460M, F466N, F470N) with a mosaic & dither scheme designed to fill in the inter-SCA and inter-module gaps. The SHALLOW4 read-out mode is used with NGRPS=3, with 3 primary dithers & 2 sub-pixel dithers to yield an on-source integration time of 902 sec per position.

To align NIRCam's A & B modules perfectly along the jet axis, V3PA = 292 degrees is needed.

A combination of primary dithering INTRAMODULEX with 6 primary dithers and a small ROWS=1, COLUMNS=2 mosaic is then used to map the jet. The INTRAMODULEX primary dither fills the inter-SCA gaps both transverse to and along the flow. The 2 COLUMNS with an overlap of 84% ensure that the large inter-module gap is filled along the length of the jet.

The same mosaic is made at two positions separated by ~65" perpendicular to the jet axis, to ensure that the jet does not fall in the lower S/N inter-SCA gaps, and to increase the overall field, maximising the number of stars detected for accurate registration and proper motion measurements. The full coverage is then approximately 6.1 arcmin along the jet and 3.5 arcmin transverse to it.
No separate nearby blank sky observations are planned.
