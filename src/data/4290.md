## ABSTRACT

Young, edge-on circumstellar disks are uniquely valuable laboratories for planet formation studies. With the central star occulted from direct view, the disk is clearly seen as a central dust lane flanked by reflected light from its upper and lower surfaces. The detailed morphology and chromaticity of these nebulae provides crucial information on disk vertical structure and the properties of its constituent dust grains. Spectral energy distributions and very limited groundbased imaging have shown that edge-on protoplanetary disks continue to be dominated by scattered light even out to wavelengths of 20 microns. JWST imaging of these targets therefore offers the unique opportunity to probe the disk interior between the optical scattered light surface seen with HST and the cold midplane emission seen by ALMA. We propose broad-band NIRCam and MIRI imaging of thirteen edge-on protoplanetary disks spanning a range of central star properties and evolutionary states. The targets are the most nearby objects of their class and thus should be vertically resolved by JWST even at wavelengths >= 7 microns. The images will reveal the wavelength evolution of both the dust lane thickness and the strength of forward scattering, which when interpreted by model fitting will allow us to derive the grainsize as a function of height in the disk and thus the extent of dust vertical settling. This project will empirically quantify for the first time how the dust size increases toward the disk midplane (a necessary condition to efficiently form planetesimals) across a broad disk sample, leaving a legacy of fundamental importance for our understanding of protoplanetary disk evolution.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The baseline observation set will be in five filters to probe the evolution of the disk scattered light nebulosity with wavelength. As the target stars are variable, we require all the observation of each target to execute consecutively without interruption.

The NIRCam observations consist of F200W/F444W and F115W/F300M image pairs. All of our primary targets are smaller than 10 arcsec in extent. We will image with the full array without large dithers, but with subpixel dithers at 4 positions to reject bad pixels and build up subsampled images. These images are designed to sample the wavelength evolution of the nebula structure, taking advantage of JWST's stability to make the best strehl ratio images ever obtained for these targets from J to M band. The S/N and PSF quality are crucial for good modeling results: the brightness gradients of the two disk nebulae as they fade into the central dark lane are the primary observables constraining the disk scale height.

The baseline MIRI observation is one image in F770W only. It will be four-point dithered with the extended source dither scale. Three of our disks are larger/thicker and thus it should still be possible to resolve the dark lane out to longer wavelengths. For those three targets (Flying Saucer, Gomaz Hanburger, CB 26, Cha IR Nebula) we include MIRI F1280W and F2100W observations to trace the evolution of the dark lane thickness over the full JWST wavelength range.

Due to the variation in integrated brightness and nebular area (by as much factors of 5 between targets), the exposure times must be tailored for each target for both instruments.
