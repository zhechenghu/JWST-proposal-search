## ABSTRACT

V346 Nor is the first member of the FUor class that has been observed to switch to a very low-accretion phase, followed by the onset of a new accretion outburst. VLT/SINFONI imaging reveals a complex system of H2 jet knots, whose spacing provides a record of at least 3 eruption events that took place during the past centuries. The orientation of the jet axis seems to change systematically, which suggests that the jet-launching disk is precessing. Our goals are (a) to obtain deep images of the bow-shock morphology in order to validate the precessing jet interpretation, (b) to associate, for the first time, a jet knot to a specific accretion outburst event, (c) to reconstruct, for the first time, the past outburst history of an FUor, (d) to search for the putative companion that could be responsible for triggering the outburst and the observed jet precession, and (e) to search for bodies that might have been ejected as part of the outburst-triggering event. This will provide much-needed insights on the outburst-triggering mechanism in FUors. Also, we will search for ejecta that might have been launched during the new high accretion phase event that started in 2011.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose deep JWST/NIRCam imaging in the H2 2.12 micrometer shock-tracer line (SW F212N filter) and the nearby continuum (LW F250M filter) that will allow us to:
(a) Confirm the precessing jet interpretation, based on deep imaging of the bow-shock morphology;
(b) Measure the H$_2$ jet knot proper motions to determine their launching dates;
(c) Search for a jet knot that might have been launched during the 2011 outburst event;
(d) Search for the putative companion,
(e) Search for potential runaway bodies
