## ABSTRACT

Clouds and hazes are crucial components of planetary atmospheres. We will obtain MIRI MRS 5â€“18 micron R~2000-3700 spectra of nine young and old cloudy extrasolar atmospheres to i) investigate how dust cloud mineralogy, particle size, and crystallinity depend on surface gravity, and ii) prove the existence of iron-rich silicate clouds in young giant planet analogs. This will shed light on crucial atmospheric processes that are currently lacking in our models to successfully reproduce current and future JWST observations of cloudy atmospheres. JWST MIRI is the only facility able to provide the necessary observations. The low-SNR of most Spitzer IRS mid-infrared spectra of substellar atmospheres prevents the proposed study.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose to use MIRI MRS to obtain mid-infrared intermediate-resolution spectra of nine young and old brown to investigate the complexity of cloud composition in their atmospheres.
Our targets have WISE W3 magnitudes between 9.3 and 11.6 mag. We will use MIRI MRS with the all three grating settings, FULL subarray, FAST1 readout pattern, 50-300 groups per integration, one-to-two integrations per exposure, and two dither positions to obtain 5-18 micron R~2000-3700 spectra with SNR>50 at 13 micron with exposure times between 14 and 167 minutes. For target acquisition, we will use the F1000W filter, the corresponding acquisition mode for MRS, a FULL subarray, a FAST readout pattern, and four groups, which leads to SNR>250 for all targets. There are no special requirements for these observations.
