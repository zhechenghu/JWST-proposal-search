## ABSTRACT

We propose the MIRI survey for Exoplanets Orbiting White-dwarfs (MEOW), an ambitious endeavor aimed at detecting and characterizing the elusive population of exoplanets that orbit white dwarfs. Utilizing MIRI broadband imaging and a powerful combination of infrared excess and direct imaging techniques, the MEOW survey will be capable of detecting white dwarf exoplanets at all separations, from the Roche limit to hundreds of AU. With a sensitivity that extends to extremely cold temperatures, the MEOW survey can detect exoplanets as small as Saturn for the nearest systems, and planets with temperatures as low as 175 K, equivalent to a 2 Jupiter mass at 3 Gyr, out to a distance of 16 pc. We expect to detect 6 +/- 2 exoplanets around white dwarfs from our sample, roughly doubling the number of currently known planets around white dwarfs and enabling the first precise constraints on the occurrence rates of gas giants orbiting white dwarfs. These observations will represent an important step towards understanding the fate of planetary systems after stellar death.

The MEOW Survey is well suited for the JWST Survey Program: The proposed detection methods are most effective for nearby systems, and therefore our target list includes the 72 isolated WDs within 16.8 pc. The sample is uniformly distributed in RA and DEC, which will ease scheduling. The total charged time per target is only 94 minutes, and the observations produce a relatively low data-volume of 1.0GB/target.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request JWST time to survey up to 72 white dwarf systems for exoplanet companions. We will observe each system in three filters: one filters (F7700W) for 55 sec exposure time, and at F1800W and F2100W with a total exposure time of 5 and 12 minutes, respectively. We will use a cycling 4-point dither pattern for all our observations. For each observed target, there is 0.28 hours of science time for a total of 1.58 hours of charged time.
