## ABSTRACT

    Brown dwarfs represent a sizeable fraction of the stellar content of the Galaxy and their masses populate the transition between the stellar and planetary mass regime. There is not an accepted explanation on how they form, making them a key element in understanding the origin of stellar masses and their distribution. As brown dwarfs evolve and cool down, their atmospheres resemble those of gas giant extrasolar planets, providing easier targets to observe and investigate the physical and chemical processes in low-temperature atmospheres. The new observational frontier is therefore the discovery and spectral characterization of the coldest and least massive brown dwarfs to test formation theories and advance the physics of cool atmospheres.

    This is the main driver behind the NIRSpec part of this proposal, where we will perform low and medium resolution slit spectroscopy of WISE 08550714, the coldest known brown dwarf (250 K), which is also the Sun's 4th closest neighbour, to test model atmospheres at very low temperatures.

    Additionally, the NIRCam, NIRISS, and MIRI GTO teams will also observe WISE 0855-0714 (please refer to their GTO program description for a science justification).

    NIRSpec proposal ID: R65.00

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    NIRSpec: We will acquire low and medium resolution spectroscopy with the S200A1 slit and the PRISM/CLEAR and G395M/F290LP configurations.

    Scientific justification for requesting that observations are executed in a non-interruptible sequence:
    WISE0855 is known to be a variable brown dwarf (e.g., Esplin+2016). Acquiring these JWST observations in a non-interruptible sequence is the only available solution to minimize the uncertainties the variability causes when comparing the observations to atmospheric models and reach a coherent interpretation of its atmosphere, which is the main goal of this program.

    [Deprecated]The proposal target has a very high proper motion (~8/year), and its position in 2019 can be predicted with an accuracy of only 40 mas given the best available measurements of its proper motion and parallax. That accuracy is insufficient for NIRSpec target-acquisition with the MSA. We will change the TA method to "WATA" once it becomes available in APT 25.4.
