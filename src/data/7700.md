## ABSTRACT

We propose to execute a supremely deep imaging program of a single NIRCam field to measure the size distribution of extremely small cold classical trans-Neptunian objects — with sizes as small as 1 km — as a deep and detailed probe of the process of planetary system formation. This experiment connects evidence from New Horizons spacecraft data for Pluto, Charon, and Arrokoth with outstanding questions from theoretical models, and can only be carried out with the unmatched sensitivity of JWST. This information on planetesimal sizes will not be obtainable in any exoplanet system within our lifetimes. Our results can be used as input for planetary system formation models, and will provide significant "ground-truth" comparisons for observations of protoplanetary disks made by many observatories.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This experiment will be carried out with an ultra-deep, 88.3 hour stare (open shutter time) at a single NIRCam pointing.
We built 24 identical observations, each of which includes 4 exposures that together total just under 20 ksec (5.6 hours) of clock time; we use a timing requirement to ensure that all of our observations are carried out within a ten day window. Thus, our objects will have orbital arcs of 5–10 days. The total requested clock time is 135.1 hours.
Of course, we will work with STScI technical staff to perfect this plan in our Phase II preparation.
