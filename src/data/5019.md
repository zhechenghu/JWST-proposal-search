## ABSTRACT

A two decade-long debate has not yet settled on the impact of TP-AGB stars in the near-IR rest-frame spectra of quiescent galaxies in the distant Universe. Wildly varying model-treatment of this uncertain but hyper-luminous stellar phase results in major discrepancies in their inferred stellar masses, ages, and star-formation histories, preventing a solid description of the evolution of this crucial class of galaxies and the overall understanding of the quenching process. JWST has the unique power to finally settle the debate, revealing (or not) the distinct spectral features that betray TP-AGB stars in galaxies' near-IR rest-frame spectra. A single massive (2x10^10Msun) quiescent galaxy from the archive at z=1.086, serendipitously observed with NIRSpec+PRISM, has surprisingly revealed a pletora of strong TP-AGB features, including those of C- and O-type stars. The features observed in this galaxy's spectrum are incompatible with AGB-poor models, but even current AGB-strong models (from Maraston et al.) are incapable of returning acceptable fits and reproducing all features. We propose to dedicate one NIRSpec pointing of 2.5h (4.6h with overheads) to observe as primary targets >10 similarly bright quiescent galaxies, spanning a larger range of masses (10^10--10^11.5), redshifts (1<z<2.5), stellar ages and metallicities. Fainter quiescent galaxies and luminous non quiescent galaxies at the same redshifts will be used as fillers. These observations will deliver a unique database to start grasping the phenomenology of TP-AGB stars in distant galaxies, and tune future generations of models to finally have accurate predictive power on key stellar population parameters.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal is taking NIRSpec spectra of quiescent galaxies at z>1 in a single pointing, using the PRISM.
