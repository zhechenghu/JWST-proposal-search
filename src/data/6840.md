## ABSTRACT

We propose a comprehensive study of Oval BA, a major anticyclonic vortex on Jupiter that has not been observed by JWST. NIRCam images separated by 10 hours (one Jupiter rotation) will utilize JWST's newfound ability to measure high-precision velocity fields in hazy areas (such as Oval BA) at altitudes some 35 km above the level probed by visible-wavelength imaging used in the past. This first-ever direct measurement of vertical wind shear in Oval BA---a fundamentally different class of vortex than the Great Red Spot---will advance the velocity field data from a 2D to a 3D paradigm in the JWST era. We will interpret the results using numerical simulations with vertically variable stratification, another 3D step that has profound effects on modeled vortex physics. NIRSpec IFU observations will quantitatively determine the altitude of wind tracers, and a MIRI IFU spectrum will measure the 3D thermal structure in the vortex and its surroundings. Over 15 years of archival visible-wavelength data will be used to quantify dynamical and photometric trends.

The program will advance our understanding of vortex dynamics in shear flows with variable stratification, a class of phenomena covering protoplanetary disks, terrestrial ocean vortices, and vortices on other giant planets. We will use dynamical models to extend shallow observational results into the surrounding deep atmosphere, providing a reference for future microwave retrievals. The combination of our thermal, compositional, and wind shear measurements with new numerical simulations will place constraints on the meridional and vertical flows, part of the climate circulation that cannot be directly measured.
