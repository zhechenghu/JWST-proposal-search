## ABSTRACT

A re-measurement of the NIRISS distortion and offset from the Guider is requested for trending of any possible changes in the astrometric distortion with time. A single epoch observation will be made in all the NIRISS imaging filters using the same pointing in the Large Magelanic Cloud astrometric field as was used for this purpose in commissioning and in both cycle 1 calibration and cycle 2 calibration.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The program carries out an astrometric calibration of NIRISS using the same method as what was done during commissioning. It is a continuation of cycle 1 program 1501 and cycle 2 program 4471.
The target field is always visible and there are currently no constraints on when in cycle 3 the observations should be taken.
The program here is based on CAR 1087, the initial NIRISS astrometric calibration.
