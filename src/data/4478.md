## ABSTRACT

Observations of two stars, selected to be single stars, will be made in the AMI mode with the three medium-band filters to test that the star can be positioned consistently at the centre of a pixel allowing for the filter-to-filter offsets that are observed in normal imaging. Having a consistent position for the observations in different filters is helpful in the analysis of the amplitudes and phases of the interference pattern observed through the mask, and should improve the AMI sensitivity.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

For each of the stars we will acquire the star in the usual manner in F480M and then apply offsets in the observations in the F430M and F380M filters which should centre the star consistently within a pixel for all three observations. We need to do this for both stars in a non-interruptable sequence because we are testing the placement for general science observations that would normally execute together, and so we wish to have the same guide star and orientation for the entire set of observations.
