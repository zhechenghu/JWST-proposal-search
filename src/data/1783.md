## ABSTRACT

We propose JWST observations of the FEAST (Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers) sample. Breaking away from the Milky Way backyard, the FEAST targets are selected from the larger parent sample of Local Volume Galaxies (LVL, D<11 Mpc) and have unparalleled wavelength coverage (including HST, MUSE, ALMA). They are representative of the star formation spectrum accessible in the local Universe, with its diversity of environments (nuclear starburst vs. molecular ring, diverse arm morphologies, interacting systems, low pressure dwarf environments). NIRCam and MIRI imaging at unprecedently charted spatial resolution (~ pc) will prove to be a breakthrough for our understanding of the interplay of star formation (SF) and stellar feedback, as the Spitzer observatory was for Milky Way studies. We estimate to detect thousands of emerging clusters with masses above thousand solar mass, and sample well above the le4 mass limits typical of our Milky Way. The JWST-FEAST project will: 1) Probe timescales for emerging clusters as a function of cluster mass and galactic environment. We will answer the fundamental question regarding the role that cluster feedback plays in regulating the SF cycle in galaxies, necessary to constrain state-of-art detailed simulations. 2) Account for the hidden phases of SF, by mapping the tempo-morphological evolution of H II and photo-dissociated regions, and determine their relative contribution to the total emission of the star-forming region. These results will calibrate self-consistent spectral evolutionary models of stars, gas, and dust necessary to study SF in galaxies that JWST will uncover beyond the local Universe.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose NIRCam and MIRI imaging observations of the FEAST sample, consisting of 6 local galaxies with pre-existing exquisite legacy of observations, representative of the spectrum of star-forming systems accessible in the Local Volume (LV, D< 11 Mpc).

The coverage of the galaxies is achieved with a FULLBOX 4TIGHT primary dither and a complementary 2-step STANDARD small pattern. We use MIRI mosaics of 1x5(3) tiles to cover the same areas. We request exposure times that will give us a minimum S/N of 10 in all the covered bands. The NIRCam broad bands are generally acquired with readouts BRIGHT1, except for the F200W and F444W where we use SHALLOW4 for the distant targets (>7 Mpc). The narrow band filters (F187N and F405N) are acquired with SHALLOW2 (or 4). NGROUPS are set to a minimum of 4 and are increased based on the distance of the galaxy. For the 2 MIRI filters we use 4-POINT dither pattern and FAST readout mode. NGROUP=10 for the closest targets (4 Mpc) and is increased accordingly to the distance. We have tested saturation limits in point sources of different nature. For the broadbands we use 5e5 Msun 10 Myr old cluster spectrum. At this stage clusters host numerous red super giants, which makes them reach the brightest luminosity at 1-5 micron. For narrow bands we use a very compact 5e5 Msun 2 Myr old cluster. We reach only partial saturation and there is always a sufficient number of groups to recover the flux of these systems in the unlikely case that they exist in the targets (currently not detected in the available optical catalogues). Position angle ranges are provided for all the targets to ensure the maximum overlap with ancillary archival datasets.

The resulting NIRCam observation efficency (science/total exp time) is 30 % in the closest targets and 50% in targets at distance >= 7 Mpc. For MIRI efficency goes from 20 to 40 %. In total we request 45h.
