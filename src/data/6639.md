## ABSTRACT

This activity is needed to verify and trend the behavior of the two NIRSpec wheel mechanisms (FWA and GWA). Pending any unexpected behavior, the FWA characterization and GWA characterization will each be done once during Cycle 3 (in October).
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

A series of mechanism move commands is issued to step the Filter Wheel and Grating Wheel—in separate visits—one position at a time through all eight wheel positions, in both the forward and reverse directions. At each position, the high capacity (HC) buffer is armed before a move and then dumped after the move. The procedure collects NIRSpec-focused telemetry data in the HC buffer at each commanded wheel position and writes it to the on-board Solid State Recorder (SSR) for analysis after the procedure and SSR playback of the resulting telemetry data are completed.
