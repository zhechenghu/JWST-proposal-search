## ABSTRACT

We will observe three dwarf spheroidal companions of the Andromeda Galaxy M31, to determine their bulk proper motions. The targets are And XXII, XIV, and XVII, and their PMs will help advance our dynamical understanding of the M31 system. Proper motions will be determined either from comparison to existing HST data, or from comparison to similar JWST observations obtained in GTO Cycles 1.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will image four satellites galaxies of M31 with NIRCAM using the F150W+F277W filters. We will also obtain parallel field images with NIRISS with F150W. To minimize systematic errors in the proper motion determination, it is essential that the observations be obtained at the same telescope orientations as for our corresponding Cycle 1 observations. For those targets that have yet to execute in Cycle 1, the orientations in this Cycle 3 program will be updated after the Cycle 1 observations have been completed.
