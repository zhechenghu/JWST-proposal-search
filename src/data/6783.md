# 6783 - NIRCam observations of a star forming nebula and young cluster
https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=6783
## OBSERVATIONS TABLE
1.  **List of the Labels, corresponding Observing Template, and Science Targets:**

    | Label                   | Observing Template | Science Target    |
    | :---------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- |
    | Star_sf_reg_1_NIRCam    | NIRCam Imaging     | (1) star-sf-reg-1 |

## ABSTRACT
    We will observe this star forming region and young cluster in 3 NIRCam wide filters, 2 narrow filters, and 1 medium filter, sufficiently deeply to allow for the creation of low-noise color-composite images.
