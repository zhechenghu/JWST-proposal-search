## ABSTRACT

JWST was designed to discover and study the first galaxies. And JWST has delivered: more detailed studies of z <= 9 galaxies than most of us dreamed, and more discoveries of z >= 10 galaxies than most expected. But detailed studies of z >= 10 galaxies in the first 500 Myr have remained elusive due to the bright [OIII] emission line redshifting beyond NIRSpec's wavelength range.

Emission lines have recently been detected for the first time at z > 10. MACS0647-JD lensed to AB mag 25.1 was discovered in Hubble imaging, revealed to be merging galaxies in JWST NIRCam imaging, and is now confirmed spectroscopically at z = 10.17 with 5 emission lines observed in NIRSpec PRISM data.

Here we propose higher resolution spectroscopy spanning 3000Å – 7000Å rest-frame in the first detailed study of a galaxy at z = 10:

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We proposed the following observations on the MACS0647+70 cluster field and primary target lensed galaxy images JD1 and JD2:

*   4.2 hours MIRI MRS SHORT (A) spectroscopy on JD1 + F560W imaging on JD2
*   4.2 hours MIRI MRS LONG (C) spectroscopy on JD1 + F770W imaging on JD2
*   2.5 hours NIRSpec spectroscopy G395H/F290LP high resolution
*   0.6 hour NIRCam imaging F200W + F410M

MIRI requires specific roll angles to obtain MRS observations of one target JD1 and imaging of the other JD2.

NIRSpec MSA observations are now specified at the assigned roll angle. We split our observations into two pointings in order to cover the wavelength gap and observe more targets:
– Pointing 1: standard 3-shutter slitlets and nods
– Pointing 2: single shutter slitlets with 2 dithers + master background slitlets added by manually editing the configuration
