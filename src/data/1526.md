## ABSTRACT

This activity will monitor the accuracy of the mapping of astrometric position in the sky to x,y pixel coordinates on the two MRS detectors. It will observe a region within the JWST astrometric field with the MRS, MIRI imager, and FGS simultaneously with the goal of measuring the location of the MRS field in V2,V3 space, the distortion across the MRS field of view, and the same quantities in the MIRI imaging field. Distortion in the MRS is particularly important to monitor throughout the mission; the relative positions of the field of views are not expected to change substantially after commissioning, and this activity will demonstrate that near the end of Cycle 1.
Targets and observing strategy for this programme are based on commissioning activity CAR-MIRI-007 (program 1024) and OTE-34 (program 1171).

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The plate scale and geometric distortion of the MIRI Imager (MIRIM) and MRS will be measured using dithered pointing observations of the JWST astrometric calibration field. A moderately bright (~ 6 milliJansky at 5 microns) star will be observed with the MRS at 4 dither offset positions. Simultaneous exposures with the MIRI Imager (using fainter stars than for the MRS to leverage the difference in sensitivity between imager and MRS), will provide thousands of centroids which will be used to solve for the transforms between MIRIM and MRS detector coordinates and sky (V2,V3) coordinates; (see, e.g., https://github.com/STScI-MIRI/miricoord/)
