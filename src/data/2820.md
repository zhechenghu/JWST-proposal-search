## ABSTRACT

Outer solar system small bodies (Centaurs, Comets, small TNOs) hold the residual ingredients from our young protosolar disk that are still observable today. Thus, by measuring their composition and distribution across the solar system we have the potential to unravel the scenario of our planetary system's formation and dynamical evolution, providing a benchmark to which other stellar systems can be compared. We propose performing spectroscopic observations with MIRI (over the 5-28 micron range) of 2 Centaurs and 2 small TNOs to constrain their silicate composition. We will observe a “less red” and a “very red” object within each population. Our proposed investigation will first enhance our understanding of the overall compositional diversity among primitive outer solar system small bodies, thereby complementing Cycle 1 observations of these bodies with NIRSpec. Second, we will provide critical information regarding the extent of radial mixing among primordial small bodies which took place during their early reorganization. Specifically, our measurements will allow us to confirm/refute the genetic link between outer (Centaurs, small TNOs) and inner (P/D type asteroids, Jupiter Trojans) solar system small bodies, as advocated by the Nice model. Finally, our proposed observations will provide unique constraints on the primordial heliocentric compositional gradient present in the outer (>10 AU) protosolar disk.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will measure the surface composition through mid-infrared spectroscopy with MIRI of 4 small (diameter < 300 km) outer solar system bodies (2 Centaurs, and 2 scattered TNOs). As a byproduct, the proposed observations will provide the distribution of silicates across the primordial outer (>10AU) solar system protoplanetary disk, complementing well the constraints already obtained by measuring the composition of cometary dust.

Both the low-resolution (5-14 m) and the medium-resolution (5-28 m) spectroscopy modes of the JWST/MIRI instrument will be used to cover the diagnostic 5-28 m range. The low-resolution mode will allow achieving a higher SNR in the critical 10-micron region where silicates display the strongest emission feature. In the wavelength range covered by the medium-resolution mode, a spectral resolution of 100-200 is sufficient to capture the most diagnostic stretching and bending silicate emission modes. We will therefore rebin the R~1500-3000 data acquired in medium-resolution mode to R~100-200, thus increasing the SNR.
