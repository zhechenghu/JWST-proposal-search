## ABSTRACT

We propose to undertake the first systematic study of Virgo cluster galaxies using resolved stellar populations. We will acquire NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W) and NIRISS (F115W, F277W) imaging of resolved red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars for 80 luminous and diverse galaxies (-16 <M_V < -23) in "subcluster A", the dominant substructure in the Virgo cluster, in order to construct and analyze each galaxy's resolved star color-magnitude diagram (CMD). From these CMDs we will: (1) make the first resolved 3D map of galaxies within Virgo's virial radius (Rvirial~1.6Mpc) using precise relative TRGB distances (~1.5%; 240kpc; 0.15Rvirial in Virgo); (2) use resolved AGB stars to measure the SFH (and SFH gradient) for each galaxy to a similar quality and level of detail as galaxies near the Local Group (e.g., the ANGST program); (3) calibrate surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance indicators for JWST using precise TRGB distances and detailed knowledge of each galaxy's resolved stellar populations for a statistical sample of galaxies that span a range of morphological types and stellar populations (e.g., colors); (4) use parallel NIRISS observations to resolve and map the diffuse, intracluster stellar populations.

This Treasury program will (i) provide qualitatively new insight into Virgo and the impact of cluster environment on galaxy evolution and (ii) anchor a uniform SBF distance scale that will enable a broad range of science for a diversity of galaxy types to ~300 Mpc (e.g., distances to transient hosts, mapping matter distributions, local H0). JWST is the only telescope that can systematically resolve stars throughout Virgo.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program will obtain NIRCam and NIRISS photometry of 80 luminous galaxies belonging to the Virgo Cluster, with the goal of determining precise distances and star formation histories for the whole sample, resolving the 3D structure of the Virgo cluster, calibrating a surface brightness fluctuation distance scale in JWST filters, and study the intracluster stellar population of Virgo. Parallel NIRISS imaging will enable the characterization of intracluster stars and the discovery of new orphan globular clusters and faint dwarf galaxies.

For 76 of our targets, each visit will acquire NIRCam photometry in (F115W, F277W) and (F150W, F277W), using 4 dithered exposures, 1 integration per exposure, and the SHALLOW4 readout. The integrations will have 7 groups for the (F150W, F277W) exposures and 9 groups for the (F115W, F277W) exposures. Parallel NIRISS imaging will consist of 4 dithered exposures with 1 integration and 8/10 groups, using the (F115W, F277W) filters. The remaining 4 galaxies will be observed by NIRCam in only the (F115W, F277W) filter pair, using the same set up in order to measure star formation histories and provide uniformity. NIRISS will be used in parallel to acquire F115W imaging. This observational set up has been tuned to obtain robust photometry of the AGB population, a photometric depth that allows a robust measurement of the TRGB magnitude, and sufficient depth to obtain a measurement of the surface-brightness fluctuations.

For 76 targets, the special requirement OFFSET has been used to center the target on one of the two NIRCam modules. For the remaining 4 galaxies, the OFFSET requirement and PA range requirements have been set to match the position and orientation of archival NIRCam and NIRISS imaging.
