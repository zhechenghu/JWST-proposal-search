## ABSTRACT

Large Asteroids: Recent work has shown that asteroids over 200 km in diameter are intact remnants of earliest Solar System history, and that these objects had dynamic histories with ongoing processes. Our JWST observations of the three largest low-albedo asteroids will extend measurements of Ceres far beyond the wavelengths measureable by Dawn, and provide unique measurements of Pallas and Hygiea that are unavailable from other platforms.

Trojan Asteroids: The Trojan asteroids are key to understanding early solar system dynamics and planetary migration. They are thought to be organic-rich, but their distances and low albedos make observations difficult. We target targeted binary asteroids to take advantage of knowledge of their densities, which we will combine with the compositional data gained from spectroscopy. One of the targets is a planned destination for NASA's Lucy mission in 2033.

This proposal includes Observation IDs HAMMEL_0001-0005, 0009-0014, and 0025-0027/
