## ABSTRACT

We propose a JWST-MIRI program to systematically trace the chemical evolution over the lifetime of planet-forming disks, using the complete sample of 30 disks recently observed by the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO, 103h). This sample is the first systematically selected sample to study gas properties at three key evolutionary phases of planet-forming disks: the embedded disk phase, the middle age, and the end of the disk lifetime. The ALMA observations uniquely determine the mass distributions and chemical structures of the outer disk region (>20 au). JWST MIRI spectra will constrain the abundances of the main volatiles (e.g., H2O, CO, CO2) in the terrestrial-planet forming region (<10au). By combining JWST/ALMA observations of the full-age-range sample, this program will provide the very first answers to two fundamental questions of the chemical evolution during planet formation: (1) How do the volatile budgets in the gas of the terrestrial-planet-forming region evolve over the disk lifetime? (2) How do pebble growth and drift affect volatile compositions in the inner and outer regions of planet-forming disks? The results will be a key legacy dataset to test theories of chemical evolution in planet formation, and provide an essential context to link the atmospheric compositions of exoplanets to their formation and migration history.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program observes molecular emission from protoplanetary disks in the ALMA AGE-PRO survey of gas evolution in protoplanetary disks. We target 28 out of the 30 disks in the AGE-PRO program, as two of the disks have been covered by an MIRI GTO disk program with similar sensitivity requested here. All observations are obtained with MIRI-MRS across the full wavelength range, to observe molecular lines from abundant volatile species (e.g., H2O, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2). We aim for SNRs of 100-200 at the 22um, to firmly detect known molecular tracers and have good constraints on optically thin lines. We expect 18 Class II disks to be unresolved, and therefore we choose the standard 4-point dither for point sources. We request the observation of an asteroid to precisely remove the MRS fringes, as described in Pontoppidan et al. 2023. The asteroid calibrator is requested in the spring 2024 window to be applicable to the full science sample in Cycle 2.
