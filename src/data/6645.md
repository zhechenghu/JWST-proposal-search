## ABSTRACT

This program is intended to expand the flux calibration of the IFU mode (F-Flats) into the chip gaps as far as possible. For that we request standard star observations in the center of the IFU as well as in two corners of the IFU aperture, such that all slices are covered.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program is intended to cover most slices of the NIRSpec IFU with spectrophotometric standard stars in order to close the chip gap of our F-Flats as much as instrumentally possible. Furthermore, these observations will be used to improve our current F-Flats.
Two different spectrophotmetric standards are requested becasue the PRSIM requires a fainter source due to saturation.
The offsets are provisional and might be adjusted if needed to properly cover the corner of the aperture without impacting the PSF.
