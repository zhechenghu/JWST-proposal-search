## ABSTRACT

For too long, the supernova dust community has been focused on Type II supernovae (SNe II) as the primary dust factories in the Universe, mainly overlooking stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). However, the earliest cosmic dust likely emerged from the explosions of massive, short-lived stars--SESNe. With JWST's unparalleled capabilities, we can now monitor SESNe in the infrared and unlock the secrets of early dust formation and evolution. SESNe provide a unique laboratory for studying molecules like CO and SiO, which cool the ejecta to temperatures conducive to dust formation. The detection of CO in SESNe signals their untapped potential to reshape our understanding of cosmic dust production. This proposal aims to observe four SESNe over five epochs, capturing the rapid, evolving CO and SiO formation processes, their potential condensation into dust, dust onset, and dust growth over time. These multi-epoch observations will reveal the birth of dust in these SNe and distinguish between dust formed after the explosion and dust preexisting in the environment. SESNe, once neglected cousins of SNe II, may play a key role in contributing to the dust we observe in galaxies near and far, a hypothesis that this study aims to explore. By tracking the evolution of molecules and dust in SESNe, we will not only advance our understanding of stellar deaths, but also gain insights into the origins of cosmic dust, insights that may help us piece together the puzzle of the early universe's first metal-rich environments. This is an exciting and transformative moment in our exploration of cosmic dust.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request 4 non-disruptive ToO triggers, to obtain spectroscopic sequence of 4 stripped-envelope supernovae from ~30-600 days past maximum light. Data will be taken at five epochs 30, 100, 200, 300, and 600 d. At each epoch, we will use the medium resolution mode of NIRSpec, the low resolution spectral mode on MIRI, and five images in MIRI filters from F1280W to F2550W.
