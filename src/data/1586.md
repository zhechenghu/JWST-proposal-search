## ABSTRACT

Despite ~50 years of compact object studies in the Galaxy, the physics of relativistic jet launching remains an active and open field of research. There has been important recent progress in development of state-of-the-art MHD simulations, but how these determine the emission properties is now a major focus. A deeper understanding requires us to probe rapidly changing conditions in the outflowing plasma close to the jet base, for which only piecemeal studies have been possible to-date. A key observational feature, the spectral break above which the jet becomes optically thin, provides a crucial link between light and plasma properties. It is a variable feature that needs to be tracked and linked to other jet properties, and is known to pass through the mid-infrared band.

We propose to detect this jet spectral break, and monitor rapid flux and spectral shape variations in outbursting Galactic black hole binaries using the MIRI LRS mode, to provide estimates of the variable magnetic (B) field strength and physical dimensions of the jet base. There is evidence that these properties are subject to violent variations on timescales <~1 seconds, which can have important consequences for our understanding of the inner jet B field dynamics and particle acceleration mechanisms. We will measure the B field strength and radiative energy of the jet, while any variability in flux and frequency will provide unprecedented constraints on the speed and magnitude of B field changes. The break is predicted to lie in the infrared regime during typical jetted outbursts of transient black hole X-ray binaries, so this science is ideally suited for MIRI LRS observations.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

**Aim**
Subarray rapid MIRI LRS of Galactic X-ray binaries. Scientific aim is to probe the variable physical conditions at the locations in the plasma flow associated with jet base emission, something that JWST can uniquely probe.

**Strategy**
This is a Target of Opportunity (ToO) proposal, with a non-disruptive (14d+) trigger. Programme will be triggered based on multiwavelength monitoring (both publicly available and proprietary).
We propose two observations, each ~2 hours long on-target.

**Target:**
1) GX 339-4 : Black hole X-ray binary that frequently undergoes bright outbursts.
2) Generic : Any Galactic X-ray binary that is discovered to be undergoing a standard bright jet-dominated outburst.

**Dithering:**
We are mainly interested in rapid contiguous point source time series spectroscopy. We intend to measure the background locally around the source (the field of the known fixed target is not significantly crowded).
Hence we chose MIRI slitless mode, which allows the most rapid time sampling.
This programme will also provide tests of the possibility of time series photometry with long MIRI stares. We are working with the MIRI instrument team to optimise rapid time-series MIRI data.

**Multiwavelength coordination:**
We will be arranging coordination from several global facilites (from radio to X-rays) in conjunction with JWST to test the absolute time calibration and carry out broad band science. But we are not imposing any constraints on JWST scheduling.
