## ABSTRACT

    We will characterize spectroscopically the atmosphere of PSO J318.533822.8603, a free-floating planetary mass object analog to young gas giant exoplanets detected by direct imaging around HR8799 or 2MASS J1207 - 39, twhich are also part of the MIRI GTO observations.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    We will use the MRS mode of MIRI to get a spectrum with a good S/N over the 5 - 13 microns wavelength range; these observations will be complemented at longer wavelengths by MIRI imaging observations. The images will also allow searching for other low mass cold objects in the field. The emission over the 0.6 - 5.2 microns range will be obtained with NIRSPEC observations in the prism/clear mode. Observations at higher spectral resolution will be obtained with NIRSPEC observations in the G395H/F290 mode.
