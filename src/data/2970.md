## ABSTRACT

Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planets inside 1 au. Their cores have likely formed via pebble accretion and their primordial envelopes accreted from the gas disk. There are hints of large scale inward drift of icy pebbles, possibly contributing to form sub-Neptunes, in ~1-3 Myr-old solar-type protoplanetary disks (Mstar~0.4-1.5Msun). The chemical inventory of these young disks will be soon characterized in detail via GTO and Cycle1 MIRI-MRS programs. Unfortunately, disks at later evolutionary stages, when sub-Neptunes likely accrete their envelopes, are not covered in these programs. Here, we propose MIRI-MRS observations of a well-characterized sample of ~5-10 Myr-old solar-type protoplanetary disks to reveal their chemical inventory and, by comparing with the young disks, to constrain how it evolved. By covering ~3 orders of magnitude in millimeter flux, hence dust (pebble) mass, we will also test the prediction that the C/O elemental ratio inside the snowline becomes supersolar at these old ages, especially toward the faintest disks with the smallest dust content. Our observations will provide a glimpse into the chemical composition of gas that is accreted to form the primordial atmosphere of sub-Neptunes which is critical for the subsequent atmospheric loss and chemical evolution.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request MIRI-MRS observations for 14 disks in the Upper Sco star-forming region with 2MASS names: 2MASSJ16042165-2130284, 2MASS-J16064794-1841437, 2MASSJ16120668-3010270, 2MASSJ16153456-2242421, 2MASSJ16075796-2040087, 2MASSJ16052157-1821412, 2MASSJ16123916-1859284, 2MASSJ16062196-1928445, 2MASSJ16035767-2031055, 2MASSJ16141107-2305362, 2MASSJ16153220-2010236, 2MASS-J16120505-2043404, 2MASSJ16111534-1757214, and 2MASSJ16064385-1908056.

Each observation starts with an acquisition on Target to place the source at the center of the IFU field of view. As we aim to obtain complete spectral coverage, we observe in all three grating settings: SHORT (A), MEDIUM (B), and LONG (C). Exposures are set to reach a S/N of ~200 at 16um. While acquiring the medium- resolution spectra, we take simultaneous images (at no extra time) with the F770W, F1000W, and F1130W filters as they can be used to improve the astrometric solution of individual MRS exposures. Our sources are expected to be unresolved, hence the use of the 4-Point dither pattern.
