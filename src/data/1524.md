## ABSTRACT

This activity will characterize the point spread functions (PSFs) in the MIRI medium resolution spectrometer (MRS). The primary goals are to measure the PSF in the reconstructed data cubes delivered by dither sequences that were not verified during commissioning, to measure the PSF at short wavelengths using a genuine point source rather than a slightly extended source, and to increase the SNR of the PSF and monitor any changes arising from changes in the configuration of the primary mirror. The activity will observe the bright star UMi, which is a point source at all wavelengths and will permit a proper measurement of the PSF in MRS Channels 1 and 2, as well as the planetary nebula SMP LMC 058 using dither patterns not exercised during commissioning in order to ensure full characterization in Channels 3 and 4.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This activity measures the PSF of a point source and a compact extended source (delta UMi and SMP LMC 058, respectively) in multiple extended and point-source dither patterns on the MRS.
