## ABSTRACT

The aim is to detect the thermal emission from the TRAPPIST-1 b exoplanet, an Earth mass like transiting exoplanet. The emission will be obtained from photometric observations of eclipses of the exoplanet. Given the temperature of the exoplanet, around 400 K, we will use the MIRI instrument. Five eclipses are needed to expect a Signal over Noise ratio at the 5 sigma level when using the 12.8 microns filter.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We want to observe five eclipses of the Trappist-1 b exoplanet with MIRI in the imager mode (filter : F1280W).
The observations have to be done in time-series mode with no dither, with target acquistion and in full array mode to monitor at the same time a nearby relative bright star.
We do not allow for parallel observations given the high level of stability required.
The observations are time constrained; they have to start phased for eclipses.
