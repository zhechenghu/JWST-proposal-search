## ABSTRACT

Understanding the origins and evolution of planetary systems is one of the major goals of modern exoplanetary science. In the outer regions of planetary systems, disks of planetesimals have long been thought to retain evidence of the evolution of giant planet imprinted in their morphologies though secular resonances. This is well observed in the solar system, with Neptune shepherding the bodies in the Kuiper belt, and with the planet's resonances defining the belt inner and outer edges. Such intricate interactions are however much less obvious in extrasolar systems. While both giant long-period planets and debris disks are common around other stars, very few have been observed together, leaving the role of exoplanets in sculpting outer these disks. Despite ample observational evidence of debris disks being carved by inner planets (SED, ALMA and coronagraphic images), and despite multiple dynamical models explaining their morphologies by planet stirring, we are still missing a conclusive demographic study for such sculptor planets. A recent comprehensive dynamical study of 178 debris disks found that the large majority of sculpting planets should be less massive than Jupiter. This is well below the detection limits of ground-based high-contrast imagers, explaining the low number of exoplanets detected in disk systems to date. JWST's sensitivity at 4microns will for the first time enable us to carry out a systematic survey to measure the occurence of disk-sculpting planets. We have identified the 13 systems with predicted mass and semi-major axis detectable with NIRCam, and we propose to measure the real occurence of disk-sculpting planets from this well-defined sample.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will use two primary observing modes: i) coronagraphic observations that include two roll positions and a reference star observation for close-in companions (< 3") where instrumental speckles are a limiting noise factor, and ii) standard imaging observations with two roll positions for the further out companions that are background limited. Of our 13 targets, 10 of them will be observed in coronagraphic imaging mode, where the planet to star contrasts at the predicted separations necessitate a coronagraph. We simulated the coronagraphic performance of NIRCam using the pyNRC instrument simulator, which has been validated against on-sky performance (Jarron Leisenring, priv. commu.). After testing the sensitivity of several different filters combined with planet evolutionary models, we found that F444W was consistently the best filter for coronagraphic planet detection. We will use an angular differential imaging (ADI) plus reference star differential imaging (RDI) strategy, with each star having its own PSF star. The broad range of spectral types in our program justify individual reference stars, rather than considering a self-referencing PSF-subtraction survey. Angular differential imaging will be used to overcome bad pixels and other detector effects. At the recommendation from the NIRCam Coronagraph team we picked detector read-modes (and hence exposure times) that provide a SNR of 40 above the background-limited noise floor for each planet minimum mass.

Three of our targets have planets predicted to be outside of 5”. For those, we will observe in the standard NIRCam imaging mode, where the throughputs are higher and we can get better sensitivities in the background limit. Here we will only use two rolls, and no RDI, as it only provides significant gains at small angular separations (Carter et al., 2022). These stars will saturate the detector at the inner regions of our subarrays, but only at separations inside of our expected planets. For these targets we will use medium-band filters (F210M and F480M) to cut down on backgrounds and reduce saturation. We have optimized our read patterns to minimize saturation as much as possible without significantly affecting total observing overheads.

Background contaminant vetting – We will screen for background contaminants using the F200W filter in parallel with our F444W observations, where possible. Planets at our ages and masses have F200W – F444W > 5 mag, as compared to galactic O through M stars that have F200W – F444W < 1 mag, a color contrast that we achieve outside 1” for all coronagraphic targets. The F200W and F444W SUB320 simultaneous fields of view overlap enough to allow for parallel observations for the close-in (i.e. coronagraphic) targets. For the targets where a larger field is required (far more likely to have contaminants), we will obtain simultaneous full-frame images in both bands, where we can achieve a color difference of F210M – F480M 2.5 mag outside of 5” (where we expect all the the planets). Sources are this separation can easily be confirmed as background sources from the ground. All of the disks we are observing are faint enough that we don't expect to detect the disks themselves.
