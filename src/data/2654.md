## ABSTRACT

The search for dual supermassive black holes is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Following a merger of two galaxies, the two central supermassive black holes evolve into a bound binary and further inspiral until they eventually coalesce into a single merger product. If black holes are actively accreting during the inspiral, such objects can be observed as a dual or binary quasar. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to search for such dual quasars at previously unreachable sub-kpc scales, based on the small motions of the light centroid as the two sources vary stochastically. We propose to study two kpc-scale dual quasars identified with this method and confirmed with follow-up observations at z=2-3, the peak epoch of galaxy formation. Dual quasars at this epoch are not well characterized, especially due limited wavelength coverage of key spectral features and stringent spatial resolution requirements. The unprecedented NIR sensitivity, spatial resolution, and spectral coverage of JWST will enable us to study the gas dynamics in dual quasars for the first time at these redshifts. We propose to use the IFU capabilities of NIRSpec and MIRI to study the impact of these dual quasars on their hosts and to probe the quasar fueling mechanisms, host galaxy merger signatures, host stellar continuum, and merger induced star formation.
