## ABSTRACT

We propose short NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of a galaxy-spanning fountain of multiphase gas"pumped" by a supermassive black hole. The data will demonstrate Webb's singular power to advance our understanding of the black hole feeding and feedback loop in the heart of galaxies, as well as showcase the IFU's exquisite multiwavelength synergy with archival data from Chandra, Spitzer, Herschel, ALMA, VLT/MUSE+SINFONI, and nearly every instrument aboard HST. The Abell 2597 BCG (z = 0.082) is the perfect performance demonstration target for Webb's low redshift capabilities, hosting an efficiently mappable and spectacular example of chaotic cold accretion, which may trace processes fundamental to galaxy evolution at effectively all mass scales.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We use the NIRSpec IFU G235H gratings in a four-point dithered mosaic to cover the central 6x6 arcsec^2 of the A2596 BCG at 1.7-4 microns with a resolution of 100 km/s. Background observations are not necessary for this bright target. We don't need leakcals since there are no extremely bright stars in the MSA footprint. The MIRI MRS observations of A2597 use an extended source dither to better sample the PSF. We use all gratings to cover the full 5-27 micron spectrum. We link the source and dedicated off-background observations by an uninterruptible sequence special requirement, and constrain the PA of the off-background observation to gain MIRI MRS imager observations of A2597 in three filters, using the FULL array as saturation on the nucleus is not a concern.
