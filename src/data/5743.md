## ABSTRACT

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond duration radio transients that originate at cosmological distances. Because the ionised intergalactic medium (along with the circumgalactic and interstellar media in both the host galaxies and the Milky Way) leads to a frequency dependent delay in their arrival time on the order of seconds, the electron column along an FRB line of sight can be measured to 0.1% or better, meaning they can be used as precision probes of the ionised Universe - including the elusive diffuse components. The current record holder is a recently-identified FRB from redshift 1, but other bursts exhibit frequency dependent delays consistent with an origin at even higher redshift. Of these, just one - FRB 20210912A - has been localised sufficiently precisely for follow-up, and yet no host has been seen in deep ground-based imaging at this location - to a limit 3 magnitudes fainter than any of the dozens of other known FRB host galaxies! Modeling indicates that the host of FRB 20210912A is likely a faint galaxy at z~1.3, and will be infeasible to detect with ground-based facilities. With a modest JWST imaging and spectroscopy program, we can detect the host of this FRB, confirm its record-breaking redshift, and use it to 1) support (or refute) the neutron-star magnetosphere model for FRB progenitors, and 2) extend the relationship between FRB dispersion and redshift, refining the prospects for using FRBs to determine both cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the impact of galaxy feedback on the distribution of ionised baryons.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal seeks to identify the host galaxy of FRB 20210912A, which has been shown by existing ground-based photometry to be at least ~3 magnitudes fainter than the faintest known host of a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) and is very likely at redshift > 1 (but cannot be higher than 1.8, based on the observed frequency-dependent dispersion of the FRB introduced by the ionised intergalactic medium). To do so, we will use NIRCAM photometry to identify all sources in the vicinity of the FRB localisation above a limiting Ks band magnitude of ~28.5, which would include any known FRB host galaxy out to a redshift of at least 1.8. Having identified the host galaxy via this NIRCAM pre-imaging, we will follow with a single NIRSPEC slit observation placed on the host (and oriented to cover either a nearby galaxy, or else the site of the FRB if that is offset from the galaxy centre) to identify the host redshift and characterise its properties.
