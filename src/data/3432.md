## ABSTRACT

Environment is a primary driver of galaxy evolution and yet it remains poorly understood even at its extremes in galaxy clusters. We propose a unique study using ultra-deep, archival NIRISS grism spectroscopy and NIRISS/NIRCam imaging to fully characterize the star forming, quenching, and quenched populations in a young, transitional cluster at z=1.84, caught in the process of forming its passive population. Using the immediately public NGDEEP and JEMS surveys, we will disentangle the mechanisms driving early quenching as a function of the cluster accretion history by taking a full census of cluster galaxy properties (star formation histories, stellar ages, metallicities, size/morphologies, signs of merger activity, AGN) down to lower stellar masses (log Mstellar/Msun ~ 7-8) than ever achieved in clusters during cosmic noon. This point is critical: this study will enter the regime in which secular quenching in low-mass galaxies is rare and environmental quenching can be unambiguously identified. This study will set the benchmark for all future studies bridging the transitions from proto-clusters to quenched groups/clusters.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This is an archival proposal to use the uniquely deep NIRISS spectroscopy from NGDEEP and NIRCam imaging from JEMS to fully characterize the populations in a galaxy cluster (designated HUDF46) at z=1.84 in the HUDF. HUDF46 is a transitional cluster, in the process of building its passive population (e.g. Red Sequence). NGDEEP will reach an emission line sensitivity of 10^-18 erg/s/cm2 in F115W, F150W, and F200W grism observations, reaching to log M/Msun ~ 7-8 in stellar mass, a population where environmental quenching dominates due to secular processes having long timescales. JEMS will provide high-resolution medium-band photometry at rest 0.6-1.7um.

The identification of cluster members to low stellar mass will allow a >2-3x improvement in the current measurements of cluster properties (halo mass, velocity disperion) and individual cluster member cluster-centric radii and line-of-sight velocities will be used to construct phase space diagrams that trace the accretion history of the cluster.

We will confirm the star forming and post-starburst cluster populations (to SFR~0.1 Msun/yr) using optical emission lines (Halpha+[NII], [OII], [OIII], Hbeta), and characterize (ongoing and residual) SFRs, size/morphologies and merger activity, metallicities, stellar ages, etc using spectro-photometric SED fitting with non-parametric SFHs. The cluster populations will be compared to co-eval field populations selected from within the same datasets.

Quenching and quiescent galaxies will be confirmed using the Balmer/4000A beak and any detectable emission lines and similar properties will be measured and compared to field populations.

This complete look at the populations in a high redshift, transition cluster will reveal what drives early environmental quenching in massive halos, bridging the gap between proto-clusters and groups/clusters.
