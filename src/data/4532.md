## ABSTRACT

We will obtain MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy from ~1 to ~25 microns of the local very metal-poor starburst galaxy SBS0335-052 to characterise the ISM properties and look for signatures of a massive black hole or hidden AGN.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

A 4 point dither is used for MIRI/MRS observations of the primary target, to obtain identical exposures in all 3 settings (A, B and C) . Simulatneous imaging in F770W_will be obtained to improve astrometry as recommended.
A 2-point dither with otherwise identical exposure parameters is used for obtaining a background estimate. Depednding on the actual time of observation (setting the instrument PA angle) the coordinates of the sky target will be fine-tuned so that the primary target (and its companion if feasable) is obtained in the simultaneous imaging, which will use filters F560W, F770W and F1280W.
The NIRSPEC/IFU spectroscopy will be obtained in the G140H/F100LP, G237H/F170LP, G395H/F290LP configurations, all with a 4 point dither
All the observations are to be obtained in a non-interuptable sequence.
