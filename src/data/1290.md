## ABSTRACT

The embedded protostellar phase of star formation, which occurs for a few times 10^5 years after collapse of the parent cloud, is a critical period in the evolution of a young star: during this phase the final mass of the star, the initial chemical composition (ices, gases) of the disk, its size and mass, and thus its ability to form planets, are determined. At the same time, jets and winds from the stardisk system drive outflows that disperse the natal envelope. Many physical processes occur simultaneously in the immediate surroundings of the protostar: infall of the collapsing envelope onto the disk and accretion onto the star, outflows sweeping up and shocking material, and UV photons heating, dissociating and ionizing the gas. Because of the large extinction, these processes can only be investigated using midIR to mm wavelengths. Both the physics and chemistry of the protostellar structure (stardiskenvelopejet) can be probed through unique midIR diagnostic features, namely narrow gaseous atomic (e.g., [S I], [Ne II], [Ne III], [Fe I], [Fe II], HI) and molecular (e.g., H2, HD, OH, H2O, CO2, CH4, C2H2, HCN) lines, as well as broad bands of ices (simple and more complex species), PAHs and silicates.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The bulk of the proposed observations use 600 sec integration time per setting which is sufficient to detect and image the emission features from the protostellar system and outflow. For selected protostars we use 3000 sec integration time, in order to obtain high S/N ice features.
Two dithers and all three spectral set-ups are selected to cover the full MIRI wavelength range. For two sources 4-dither pattern is used. Dither strategy is Extended, ALL which may be adjusted in the future as dithers are better understood. Small mosaics ranging from 1x1 to 3x3 MRS tiles are used, depending on source. The mosaics are placed to cover the blue part of the outflow; hence the center of the tile does not always correspond with the source position but can be offset by a few arcsec.

A single background MRS tile labelled â€˜dark' or 'background' is added to each group of sources to characterize the instrument and background at the time of observations. Science observations are linked with background observation within non-interruptible and sequenced observations. For one ice rich source, B1c, a NIRSPECIFU spectrum has been added to cover ices at shorter wavelengths.
