## ABSTRACT

SN~2024ggi was reported less than a week ago in NGC 3621; at a distance of only ~7 Mpc it is the nearest core-collapse supernova to occur in the southern hemisphere in over a decade. Furthermore, it was discovered within hours of explosion, a progenitor candidate has already been identified in archival pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images, and a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign is already underway. Here we request mid-infrared observations over the course of Cycle 3 to derive diagnostics that are simply not accessible via other means. Our proposed observations are critical for interpreting SN~2024ggi in the context of supernovae resulting from the core collapse of massive stars.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request ~6.1 hrs of observing time to carry out mid-IR imaging and spectrocopy at 3 epochs over the course of Cycle 3 using MIRI LRS, MRS, and imaging. The proposed observations will allow us to cleanly access information on the composition and distribution of material in the ejecta that is not possible at other wavelengths.
