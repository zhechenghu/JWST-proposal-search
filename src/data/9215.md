## ABSTRACT

**ABSTRACT**
Flux and wavelength calibration observations using the new multistripe subarrays and the DHS in NIRCam's SW channel. A flux standard is observed in 3 filters using all subarray configurations to verify consistent calibration in all of them. 2 additional observations are taken using one subarray configuration and the same 3 filters as a stability check. A wavelength calibrator is observed in all allowed SW filters using a single subarray configuration that samples all 8 of the spectra.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
These observations will augment the commissioning observations obtained in program 4453.

In particular, they will provide flux-calibration measurements using the G2V star P330e, A5V star 2mass-j17430448, and white dwarf GD-71, as well as a wavelength calibration measurement using A0V star eta-Dor.

Astrometric observations in the LMC are specified, but are placed On-Hold pending discussions with the exoplanets WG.

Thsee flux and wavelength calibration measurements are restricted to the filters F070W, F090W, F150W2, and F200W. Cycle-4 approved GO proposals use only F150W2, but obtaining data in the 3 filters outside the bandpass of F150W2 was judged to be worhwhile after discussion with WMO (J. Valenti, c. 3/12/2025). Exposures in F115W and F150W are excluded for now.

Dark-current calibrations are instead included in cycle-4 program 8758 (CAL-NRC-401, Dark Monitor).
