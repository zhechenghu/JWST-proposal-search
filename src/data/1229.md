## ABSTRACT
    This NIRSpec/JWST proposal, is divided into two complementary programs. In the first program, we propose to obtain low and medium resolution near-IR spectra of known and candidate brown dwarfs in two nearby star-forming clusters that are representative of different star formation environments.
    NIRSpec proposal ID: R65.20 and R65.30

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
    We will acquire NIRCam pre-imaging followed by low and medium resolution MOS/NIRSpec observations in the IC 348 cluster, including parallel observations.
