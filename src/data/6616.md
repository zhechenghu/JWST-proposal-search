## ABSTRACT

This program will measure both the Imager and MRS backgrounds at the same position in the sky on a monthly cadence for six months. Trending of the Imager background at longer wavelengths over nearly 2 years of Normal Operations shows variations in comparison with their measurements during Commissioning. Furthermore, a comparison between the MRS background at similar wavelength range with the Imager (F2550W) show a systematic difference, with MRS approximately 10% lower than the Imager. This program will provide observations in the long-wavelength Imager filters and the MRS needed to determine if a true trend exists.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.
Update: The program was granted a 6month extension to complete a One year monitoring cycle. It has been updated on 4 Nov 2024.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This version of the program will target a field near then northern CVZ. Previous versions used a target in the southern CVZ in the LMC, which is too complex of a field in the infrared for our purposes.
Each epoch includes one observation with the MRS in all three grating settings and the three long-wavelength Imaging filters in parallel and one observation in one imager filter and one MRS grating setting.
TIMING CONSTRAINTS
Observations will be obtained on a monthy cadence for the first six months of Cycle 3.
Update: The program has been granted 6 more months to complete one year of trending and monitoring the Background
