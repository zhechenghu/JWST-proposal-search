## ABSTRACT

This activity performs external flatfields (illumination flats) to provide low-spatial-frequency flatfields (L-flats) for the MIRI MRS. The data provided will probe the overall system transmission and illumination of the detectors, as a function of position in the focal plane, wavelength, and the resulting map onto position on the detectors. Repeating the similar observations obtained in commissioning (CAR-MIRI-061) will provide a valuable check on the stability of system transmission and pixel responsivity and, with the added integration time, improve the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) of the resultant L-flat. The first choice for a target is a nearby extended planetary nebula NGC 7027.

Additional observations include SMP LMC 058 and an MRS calibration lamp exposure to test photometric repeatability compared to commissioning, along with a reobservation of HR6514 in a crossed-dichroic configuration.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Observe a bright planetary nebula in a 3x3 mosaic to measure the MRS flatfield.
