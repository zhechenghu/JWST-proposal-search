## ABSTRACT

We propose to measure the first transmission spectrum of a temperate extrasolar gas giant (Teq=360 K) in order to understand the chemistry and cloud formation active in atmospheres at habitable temperatures. Using NIRSpec Prism to measure the abundances of methane, ammonia, and water in the atmosphere of TOI-1899b, we can probe the chemical diversity of the gas giant population by sampling an as-yet unobserved part of the exoplanet atmosphere parameter space. In this temperature range we can directly measure the C/N/O ratios, and hence constrain the formation and migration history of the planet. By measuring the level of muting of spectral features, we can study the cloud and haze formation processes at work in atmospheres at habitable temperatures, taking advantage of TOI-1899's similarity in gravity and instellation to terrestrial planets that will be characterized with JWST. By testing for muting of spectral features, which can only be due to clouds or hazes in TOI-1899b, we will inform the studies of temperate terrestrial planets where flat spectra can be caused by multiple degenerate processes.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe the temperate Jupiter TOI-1899b for a single transit, using the NIRSpec PRISM instrument in BOTS mode to obtain a transmission spectrum from 0.5 to 5 microns.

We will use the SUB512 subarray with the NRSRAPID readout pattern, with 5 groups per integration.
