## ABSTRACT

Observations of the zodiacal background are being taken to produce sky flats for the NIRISS F430M and F380M filters.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

These observations are intended to allow on-sky zodiacal flat field images to be made in the NIRISS F380M and F430M filters. These filters are narrower than the other NIRISS filters and are near the minimum of the zodiacal background spectrum, so they need a significant amount of time. NIRCam is taken as the primary instrument because the dither patterns available are better than what is available when NIRISS is prime.
