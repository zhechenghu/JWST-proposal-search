## ABSTRACT

This activity will obtain calibration data for all three MIRI detectors during Cycle 2 to address known issues in the calibration of the dark current. Cycle 1 revealed that the dark rate varied on inconsistent timescales and amplitudes. Our current understanding indicates that this is due to persistence from sky and telescope background when the instrument is left in a configuration with one of the longer wavelength filters in the pupil. These data will also serve to monitor any temporal changes in the dark current, and be used to flag new hot, dead, and high-noise pixels for the bad-pixel mask. The activity will produce a full suite of data for all subarrays and the full array for the imaging detector with the CCC open.

This APT file includes the CCC-open darks for Cycle 2. CAL-MIRI-200 contains the CCC-closed darks.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

All observations are to be obtained in parallel.

Observations are organized in two groups. Obs. 1-90 are to be obtained between 1 Jul and 1 Sep 2023. The trending darks group (Obs. 91-110) are to be obtained in 5-day periods spaced evenly over the first 200 days of Cycle 2.

Additional parallel observations may be planned based on knowledge gained from the current program.
