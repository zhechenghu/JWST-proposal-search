## ABSTRACT

We will observe wavelength standards in the LRS slit and in the LRS slitless mode in order to improve on the existing wavelength dispersion solution for the LRS. The four targets duplicate observations from Cycle 3 in order to check for possible variations in the dispersion and to build signal/noise and continue the process of improving the calibration at the short- and long-wavelength ends of the spectral range of the LRS.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The observations include one wavelength standard in the slitless mode and three wavelength standards in the LRS slit.
