## ABSTRACT

ROSS 458 ABc is a roughly 9 Jupiter mass object that, on the basis of its estimated mass, may be transitional between Jovian planets and brown dwarfs. It is well separated from its parent stars. As such, detailed spectral observations with JWST provide the opportunity to compare the spectral appearance of such a transitional, isolated object with lower-mass Jovian planets of comparable effective temperature but heated by being close to their parent stars. The purpose of this program is to collect such data, and compare it with the transit data from close-in Jupiters being collected under other JWST GTO programs.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program will study the atmospheric property of the T dwarf ROSS 458 ABc by taking fixed slit spectroscopy. 3 Hi-resolution gratings F070LP/G140H, F100LP/G140H,F170LP/G235H with both subarrays S200 A1 & A2 are used to cover the spectral range of 0.7-3.17 micron, which will be coordinated with mid-IR spectra from MIRI observation. SNR>~ 100 is aimed for the observation in each grating.
