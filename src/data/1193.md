## ABSTRACT

The MIRI GTO team will use JWST to probe the three nearest prominent debris disks in detail: Eps Eridani, Fomalhaut, and Vega. This program will both test the analogies with the Solar System and develop conceptual templates for interpretation of more distant systems where we can only achieve much poorer physical resolution. JWST is capable of resolving the emission of asteroid-belt analog regions around these stars. So far, the existence of such structures can only be inferred indirectly, but from analysis of spectral energy distributions, there appears to be a disk component in this region around many stars. There are two main possibilities for its origin, consistent with models for the production of zodiacal dust in the Solar System: 1) evaporation of comets at the current-day ice line of the systems; or 2) accumulation of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk ice lines, leading to fossil planetesimal belts. As a test of these alternatives, we will use MIRI coronagraphic observations at 15.5 µm to test for the existence of asteroid-belt-analogs and if they exist, to determine where they lie. MIRI imaging at 23 (coronagraphy) and 25.5 µm (conventional imaging) will detect the outer belts of these systems at angular resolutions comparable to the best images available with ALMA. The first wavelength will be optimal for any structures affected by scattered light from the star, while the second will include the full extent of the outer rings. When combined with ALMA data, the JWST observations will document the production of small grains that contribute to the halo of debris disks around luminous stars. Because these grains reach super-thermal temperatures, it should be possible to trace them from the parent body rings outward for a significant distance. The very high angular resolution with MIRI will also be ideal to search for structures at the inner edges of cold outer debris rings, structures indicative of the influence of massive planets, or the effects of other snow lines (or both).
This program is coordinated with the NIRCam GTO team to obtain images searching for massive planets around these three same stars. JWST and NIRCam have a sensitivity advantage over the ground in the 3-5 µm regime. The NIRCam instrument team is planning coronagraphic observations at 4.4 µm (with the F444W filter) to search both the interior (<10 arcsec) and exterior regions (up to 2.2 arcmin) for faint companions approaching Saturnian masses around Eps Eridani, Fomalhaut, and Vega. The interior region will be observed twice to reject background objects on the basis of source motion while entire field will be observed at 3 µm (with the F356W filter) to reject background stars and galaxies on the basis of color.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

A joint team of NIRCam and US MIRI scientists will execute a series coronagraphic observations toward 3 nearby bright stars, Vega, Fomalhaut, and Eps Eri. The goals of the program are to a) characterize the debris disks of these systems and b) to search for planets.

The NIRCam observations of Eps Eri consist of 2 epochs with F444W and F356W filters. The observations are made using both SUB320 and Full Frame Mode with the round 430 mask. Full frames are needed to ensure complete coverage of a 2.2' area surrounding the stars whose debris disks show structure well beyond the region covered in SUB320 mode. SUB320 frames are needed because of a saturation issue up to 1" for the Full frame mode. The aperture PA range constraint is set so that we cover the entire field of view for this target.

The NIRCam observations of Vega and Fomalhaut consist of a single epoch with F444W and F356W filters. The observations are made using both SUB320 and Full Frame Mode with the round 430 mask. Full frames will be used to extend the coverage of those targets although the lack of time for this program will not allow to observe the full field of view of those two targets. SUB320 frames are needed because of a saturation issue up to 1" for the Full frame mode.

For Fomalhaut we have a relatively tight time constraint so we can observe a planet candidate, Fomalhaut b, at a favorable orientation. We will use proper motions to reject background objects in the central +/-10" coronagraphic imaging area seen in 2 epochs and the F356-short wavelength color to reject single epoch candidates seen in the flanking fields. The NIRCam observations will use two roll angles (+/-5 deg) and a reference star to assist with suppression of residuals in the coronagraphic image.

For Vega, the aperture PA range constraint is set so that we can observe the 3 point sources identified in Jansen et al. 2015, carefully avoiding the edges of the NIRCam coronagraphic mask.

The exposure time was chosen to search planets down to Saturn masses at 4" assuming a 10 nm wavefront drift using the extension of COND03 models (Baraffe et al. 2003) for planetary masses down to Saturn mass (Beichman et al. 2010). At this separation, we should be able to detect a 0.3 Mjup planet with a SNR of about 5. We chose the exposure time ratio target/reference star to be sqrt(flux target/flux reference), to obtain the same SNR of the PSF for both targets. We will use the 5-POINT dither pattern to increase the contrast gain at close separation but chose not to increase the SNR of the PSF in order to maximize the time spent on the target. However, we made sure to keep a similar SNR per frame for both targets by carefully chosing the detector readout modes, number of groups and integrations.

To further characterize the architecture of these debris disks we will observe them with MIRI. We will image the systems at 15.5 microns with the Four Quadrant Phase Mask coronagraph (4QPM) and at 23 microns with the Lyot coronagraph, yielding a field of view of 24 and 30 arcseconds at each wavelength, respectively. The ~ lambda/D inner working angle of these coronagraphs, aided by the relatively high contrast of the belts compared to the central stars, will allow us to image the asteroid belt analog components. Such warm components have not been imaged around any extrasolar planetary system to date. While the colder Kuiper-belt analog components are visible at 23 microns, the reduced field-of-view will crop off a significant part of the disks. Therefore, we will also image the disks at 25.5 microns with the brightsky subarray (yielding a 56 arcsecond field-of-view), allowing us to image the full extent of the systems. Imaging of the targets is performed at two rotations, offset by the maximum allowable 10 degrees, at each wavelength. Furthermore, we will also observe two PSF standards for each target, one for the 25.5 micron imaging and another for the coronagraphic observations. The two PSFs are necessary to achieve a good S/N on the calibrators. The coronagraphic PSFs are bright, allowing us to perform a 9 point dither pattern around the center of the 4QPM and still obtain a high S/N PSF at each dither point. Unfortunately, such bright calibrators would saturate in imaging mode at 25.5 microns, requiring us to choose a fainter imaging PSF calibrator. To optimize the observations sequence, we first image the calibrators at 25.5, 23, and then 15.5 microns. This is followed by the target at 25.5, 23, and then 15.5 microns at first rotation, and then in reverse at 15.5, 23, and finally 25.5 microns at second rotation. This sequence requires only a single rotation, which is a time consuming maneuver. Furthermore, the longer timescale stability at longer wavelengths also favors the shorter wavelength observations to be executed closer in time. Finally, our targets will saturate in their cores at imaging at 25.5 microns. Our sequence avoids latent images of these cores persisting in our dataset as they are the last images observed. This imaging sequence is optimized both for time and science return.

Important:
- Whenever it is possible the MIRI observations should be scheduled with the NIRCam first visit observations of Eps Eri.
