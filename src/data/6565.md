## ABSTRACT

We will observe this galaxy with NIRCam and MIRI in both narrow and broadband filters to capture the stellar continuum, neutral hydogen gas, and PAH emission from the relatively small disk of this lenticular galaxy.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

At <10 Mpc distant, this galaxy is nearby enough that emission lines are not redshifted beyond the transmission windows of narrowband filters. We will use the F212N filter on NIRCam to isolate neutral hydrogen gas, as well as F335M to capture PAH emission in the disk. The broadband filters F090W, F200W, F277W, and F444W will provide stellar continuum colors as well as resolving globular clusters and brighter stars. MIRI observations in F770W, F1130W, and F1280W will target PAH emission in the disk.
