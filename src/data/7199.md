## ABSTRACT

We target three very-unusual “one-in-a-million” main-sequence M dwarfs that show extreme levels of mid-infrared excess flux. These objects were singled out from a sample of five million stars sampled by Gaia and WISE in a search motivated by the quest to detect technosignatures, or Dyson spheres. Regardless of the physical explanation for the mid-infrared excess, JWST's unique combination of sensitivity, spectral range and spectral and spatial resolution will allow different explanations for the excess to be tested.

Three possible explanations have been proposed for the remarkable mid-IR excess of these M dwarfs:
1) An extreme, late-forming debris disk due to collisions within their planetary systems;
2) Contamination by a rare very-luminous type of WISE-discovered obscured active galactic nucleus that only contributes significantly to the flux at wavelengths longer than 10 micron, and which happens to be projected within a few arcseconds of the M dwarf;
3) A bona-fide Dyson sphere absorbing starlight, and operating at ~100-200 K.

We propose a combination of MRS spectroscopy at 5-25 micron, along with imaging in F560W, F1000W and F1500W of the surrounding field to uncover the true nature of these objects.

This project has the potential to make: the first detection of extreme debris disks without signs of ongoing gas accretion around mature M dwarfs; a “black swan” detection of an alien civilization; or to reveal three fascinating distant galaxies masked by a foreground star, which will provide precious adaptive-optics-friendly targets for future ELT spectroscopy.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This programme will carry out MRS spectroscopy at 5-25 micron (channels 1-4, wavelength ranges A, B and C) of three M dwarfs with extreme levels of infrared excess flux. While dedicated MRS background observations are obtained in direct connection to the target observations, we will also carry out MIRI imaging in filters F560W, F1000W and F1500W of the field around the targets to characterize the surroundings and search for faint structures or contaminating objects close to the targets.
