## ABSTRACT

Located at the centre of the Milky Way, the Arches cluster is a metal-rich, young massive star cluster, pervaded by massive stars that populate the cluster mass-function up to the highest masses. Its proximity, compactness, and youth, combined with the unprecedented spectroscopic sensitivity of JWST NIRSpec, enables --for the first time-- a detailed census and characterization of its heavily reddened massive cohort. We propose NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations covering 1.66 to 5.27 Âµm of a significant fraction of the Arches, down to early B-dwarfs, at a modest observational cost. Our results will allow for the first comprehensive test of the validity of current models of radiation driven winds in a high-metallicity environment. We will also obtain a direct measurement of the extinction towards each star, breaking current degeneracies that plague ground-based and space photometric studies. Quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the rich suite of H-, He-, and metal-line diagnostics with state-of-the-art model atmosphere programs will return accurate fundamental stellar properties, including masses and mass-loss rates. This will provide a gauge of the mechanical energy, momentum and ionizing power provided by the cluster to its environment, as well as the cluster mass function and its potential top-heavy nature. Consequently, the Arches cluster will become the prototypical template for understanding clusters and their environments in more distant, metal-rich, massive star-forming galaxies.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The program consists of a NIRSpec IFU mosaic with 29 tiles of 3.0"x3.0". The mosaic is composed of two different kinds of tiles.
The provided coordinates roughly match the cluster center (e.g. Hosek et al. 2022).
The proper motion of the cluster is small, of the order of 1 mas/yr (Hosek et al. 2022), hence negligible for the observational window.

-Tiles with bright objects:
Grating: G235H
Blocking Filter: F170LP
Aperture: 0.11"
Dithering pattern: 4-Point-Dither
Detector strategy: FULL-frame with NRSRAPID read-out pattern. 5 groups per integration. 4 integrations per exposure.

Grating: G395H
Blocking Filter: F290LP
Aperture: 0.11"
Dithering pattern: 4-Point-Dither
Detector strategy: FULL-frame with NRSRAPID read-out pattern. 2 groups per integration. 8 integrations per exposure.

-Regular tiles:
Grating: G235H
Blocking Filter: F170LP
Aperture: 0.11"
Dithering pattern: 4-Point-Dither
Detector strategy: FULL-frame with NRSIRS2RAPID read-out pattern. 14 groups per integration. 1 integrations per exposure.

Grating: G395H
Blocking Filter: F290LP
Aperture: 0.11"
Dithering pattern: 4-Point-Dither
Detector strategy: FULL-frame with NRSIRS2RAPID read-out pattern. 9 groups per integration. 1 integrations per exposure.

The mosaic has been designed for a specific V3PA = 90 degrees angle.
No TA is requested. The pointing accuracy delivered by the observatory is enough.
Our observational window coincides with the Micrometeroid Avoidance Zone (MAZ).
