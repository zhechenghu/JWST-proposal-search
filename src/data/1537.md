## ABSTRACT
This program obtains observations of white dwarf stars as part of the JWST absolute flux calibration effort. This effort uses all JWST instruments to provide absolute flux calibration for all JWST modes (filters, gratings, etc). The combined nature of this effort is to ensure the highest quality flux calibration internal to and between instruments and to carry out the observations efficiently. This program provides observations of white dwarf stars and companion programs provide observations of A and G dwarf observations. The absolute flux observations will be compared to model predictions of the stars flux densities to calculate the appropriate calibration factors per instrument mode.
This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
Observations of 3 types of stars: A, G, and white dwarfs. Nominal goal is 4 stars with good observations of each type for 12 stars total. This provides for testing systematic uncertainties between type of star and a 1% accuracy per type (given 2% "weather" in modeling an individual star).
