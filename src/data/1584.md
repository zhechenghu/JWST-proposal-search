## ABSTRACT

We propose a JWST treasury program to obtain MIRI-MRS spectra of the complete sample of protoplanetary disks from the ALMA-DSHARP survey, which obtained high resolution mm-wave images of disk substructures. With MIRI-MRS data, we can produce gas-phase inventories and radial abundance profiles of molecules in the terrestrial planet-forming regions of the DSHARP disks. With these combined datasets, we create the unique potential to study how global disk evolution and planet formation are interconnected with disk chemistry. Ultimately, the chemical makeup of the disk determines the chemical reservoir out of which planets form, and therefore, the composition of planets. In addition to releasing reduced spectra, our team will produce and release several higher-level data products to the community, including line fluxes, bulk molecular parameters (rotational temperature, column density, and emitting area), and molecular abundance ratios. This combined dataset will have the power to support a broad range of investigations, and will have lasting legacy value for both the planet formation and exoplanet communities.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program obtains to observe molecular emission from protoplanetary disks in the ALMA-DSHARP survey using MIRI-MRS. We target the following 17 targets: HT Lup A/B, RU Lup, Sz 114, Sz 129, MY Lup, HD 14266, HD 143006, SR 4, Elias 2-20, DoAr 25, Elias 2-24, Elias 2-27, DoAr 33, WSB 52, AS 209, HD 163296 and AS 205 N. All observations are obtained with MIRI-MRS across the full wavelength range, to observe lines at a range of excitation temperatures, and to observe multiple molecules. We aim for SNR of 100 at the longest wavelength, to firmly detect known molecular tracers, and maximize the signal-to-noise given known systematic fringing effects. In addition, to minimize fringing, we include target acquisition when possible (for sources that do not saturate in TA mode.) We expect targets to be unresolved, and therefore choose the standard 4 point dither for point sources, optimized for all 4 spectral channels.
