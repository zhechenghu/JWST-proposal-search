## ABSTRACT

This proposal will redo the observations needed to define the NIRSpec MOS F-Flats, using white dwarf standards for cleaner spectra. We will use a different star for the G140M settings as we need one faint enough that we can get at least 3 unsaturated groups at all wavelengths.
These new observations are needed because of centering problems with the commissioning observations, (OBS 19 of PID 1128), and because the star used for commissioning has been shown to be variable at the ~1% level. It was also a bit too bright for the G140M settings.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

WATA ACQ followed by exposures at Q4 field point one, using the long slit MOS configuration
All spectral exposures use the NRSIRS2RAPID readout pattern and the standard 3 point MOS nodding pattern.
The DA WD standards GD 71 and G191 B2B are to be observed.
Results of ETC calculations for each proposed exposure are summarized below for the planned exposure sequences, (groups x integrations x dithers).
Also listed are the number of NRSIRS2RAPID groups at which the counts at the most sensitive wavelength first reach saturation, as well as the total exposure time.
ETC Workbook ID: 188149
05 GD71 G140M/F070LP 5x2x3 gives S/N 215+, 5.9 grps to saturation (525s)
04 GD71 G140M/F100LP 5x2x3 gives S/N 220+, 3.2 grps to saturation (525s)
11 GD71 G140H/F100LP 18x2x3 givs S/N 161+, 18 grps to saturation (1663s)
17 GD71 PRISM saturates in < 2 groups for < 2 microns
The PRISM observations will be useful at long wavelengths to crosscheck the MOS PRISM flux calibration determined from fainter standards.
