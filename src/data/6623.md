## ABSTRACT

This activity will observe the standard star BD+60 1753 in the LRS slitless mode to characterize the behavior of the detector when an observation goes to saturation. Three pointings will be made with the source in the nominal pointing position and a non-integer number of pixels to either side. The integration will saturate the detector at the shortest wavelengths. This activity will investigate how charge migration (the brighter-fatter effect) and the non-linearity correction in the pipeline interact.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

BD+60 1753 will be observed with an integration time long enough to saturate pixels at the blue end of the spectrum. Observations will be obtained in three positions, at the nominal pointing position in the slitless subarray, 3.5 pixels to the left, and 3.75 pixels to the right of that position.
