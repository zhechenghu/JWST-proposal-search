## ABSTRACT

This program executes successive rotations of the GWA (grating wheel assembly), one position at a time, with an internal lamp exposure taken at each position (LINE4 for the PRISM, REF for the gratings). The data will enable monitoring of the calibration of the GWA tilt sensors, which is a critical part of the NIRSpec wavelength calibration. This calibration is part of the NIRSpec instrument model, but the tilt sensors are more likely to change with time than the other internal instrument model components and will be monitored more frequently. The monitor will run approximately once a month to provide data on the GWA tilt behavior and build up statistics for a full tilt calibration if necessary.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and final science program:

As of 15 January only the August observation set and one element (of 3) from the September set have scheduled due primarily to lack of slew parallel opportunities in the various OPs within the specified 1 day execution intervals.
As of 15 January updates are made to attempt to facilitate more scheduling opportunities:
- modify all unexecuted exposures to use FIXEDSLIT as opposed to MSASPEC
- remove all SEQUENCE WITHIN special requirements and replace with GROUP WITH SRS
- incresae all GROUP WITHIN intervals to 2 days from 1 day except for late February set which uses 3 days. The intent is to make observations more schedulable.
- re-schedule July, Oct, Nov, Dec, and January sets to execute in the second half of February, March, April, May, and June.
- slight modifications of acceptable observing periods for the two Feb sets of observations due to start dates of first available Feb Op following submssion of updated program.
For now, the remaining two unexecuted elements of observatiosn set 3 (obs 8 and 9) have not yet been updated for re-scheduling.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The exposures taken at each GWA position are very short (1.5-3 minutes); in order to be able to fit observations into slews, we have split an individual rotation set into three observations, each with two or three wheel positions (obs 1: PRISM/LINE4, G395M/REF, G235M/REF; obs 2: G140M/REF, G395H/REF; obs 3: G235H/REF, G140H/REF). We added a timing requirement so that each set of three observations is taken within a 24-hour period (TBC, pending a better understanding of the typical frequency and length of slews).
