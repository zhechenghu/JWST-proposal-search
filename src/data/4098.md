## ABSTRACT

We propose to use JWST to conduct a targeted search for a long-theorized class of planet known as "water worlds". Due to its large aperture, broad infrared wavelength coverage, and ultra-stable space-based platform, JWST provides the first -- and, for the foreseeable future, only -- opportunity to unambiguously identify water worlds and characterize their atmospheric compositions. We will use NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec G395H to measure atmospheric transmission spectra for a sample of the five most promising water-world candidates identified by their bulk densities, transmission spectroscopy metrics, and the expected depths of molecular spectral features. By surveying multiple targets, our program will provide vital constraints on the existence of water worlds and will allow us to start characterizing the chemical diversity of their atmospheres. The existence of water worlds has important implications for theories of planet formation, and with compositions dominated by volatiles other than H/He, they represent a new regime of atmospheric chemistry that has until now remained uncharted by observations.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

All proposed observations are spectroscopic transit observations of the five most favorable water-world candidates transiting M and K dwarfs.

NIRISS/SOSS will be used to observe 0.8-2.8um, while NIRSPEC G395H will be used to observe 2.9-5µm. Together these observations will build a near-complete transmission spectrum between 0.8 and 5µm in the most efficient way possible for these bright target stars.

As specified by the phase constraints, all observations have to be timed to begin before the transit and end after the transit with adequate baseline on both sides.
