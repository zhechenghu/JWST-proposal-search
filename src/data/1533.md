## ABSTRACT

To provide the data necessary to transfer the photometric calibration of the MIRI imager across all subarrays, we will observe an A dwarf in the F770W filter in each subarray. The target is J1757132, which is in the continuous viewing zone.
This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.
