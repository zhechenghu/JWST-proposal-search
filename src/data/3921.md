## ABSTRACT

While explosive transient astronomy is often associated with young, rapidly evolving sources, there is a subset of dusty, old supernovae (SNe) that are quite valuable to our understanding of SN explosions and their progenitor systems. The mid-IR wavelengths span the peak of the thermal emission and are best to characterize the dust in these systems. The Spitzer Warm Mission spent over a decade building an impressive sample of dusty SNe at 3.6/4.5 microns, but this was just the tip of the iceberg. These wavelengths were insufficient to probe colder temperatures ~150 K, where a bulk of the dust is thought to reside. A number of questions remain and the phase space of such observations (in terms of dust temperature and SN age) remains relatively unpopulated. JWST offers the opportunity to build a modern, ground-breaking sample of dusty SNe. As Spitzer strategies showed, targeting one SN at a time is not only inefficient, but also risky because of the difficulty in predicting which SNe are IR bright. Here we propose an optimal strategy of using the Survey Mode to obtain MIRI imaging of a large sample of SNe of different subclasses and ages. It is imperative that such a Survey begin early in JWST's lifetime (i.e., Cycle 2) so, like the Spitzer sample, targets of interest can continue to be monitored throughout their lifetime in future cycles. We include 44 targets (~74 hours) roughly equally distributed across the sky. The results will enable a variety of new and important types of scientific investigations. The data will be made public immediately to ensure it benefits the entire SN community.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This is a survey program approved for 44 targets.

This proposal will image 44 (~74 hours) nearby SNe IIP, IIn, and other potentially dusty SNe with MIRI Imager. Each observation will consist of F770W, F1000W, F1500W, F2100W.
