## ABSTRACT

Cycle 1 observations of the planetary system HR8799 revealed a exoplanet candidate in addition to the four previously known planets. This new object is located approximately 5" South of HR8799, well outside the 1‚Äù orbits of the known systems but within the extended disk seen at longer wavelengths. The goal of this program is to determine whether this new source is associated with HR8799 or is a distant background object. If associated with HR8799, the new source will share HR8799's proper motion of approximately 100 mas/year. Relative to Cycle 1 observations obtained on November 27, 2022, we expect at least 200 mas of motion in Cycle 3 which will be easily detectable.
