## ABSTRACT

We propose a comprehensive JWST-MIRI survey for 40 Class I/FS disks in the Ophiuchus region. This survey will provide the first population study of the chemical composition and pebble drift conditions during the crucial first Myr of planet formation. Recent research indicates that planet formation may begin much earlier and proceed faster than traditionally believed, with critical planet formation processes initiating during the embedded disk stage (less than 1Myr). Previous JWST/MIRI programs have mostly focused on very young Class 0 sources (<0.2 Myr, may not have a disk yet) or older Class II disks, leaving the bulk population of embedded disks —Class I (0.1–0.6 Myr) and Flat Spectrum (FS, 0.6–1 Myr) sources-largely unexplored. MIRI spectra of a preliminary small sample of Class I/FS sources reveal that molecules such as gas-phase H2O, CO, CO2, C2H2, HCN, and OH are readily detectable. Interestingly, these spectra suggest a distinctive chemistry compared to older Class II disks, aligning with a water-rich and CO2-poor phase in the first Myr predicted by pebble drift models. Ophiuchus is the closest star-forming region with a large population of embedded disks and the only region with most of embedded disks characterized with high-resolution ALMA observations (5-10 au). Leveraging existing ALMA observations, this program will provide crucial insight into the early disk composition in the terrestrial planet-forming region and key constraints to the pebble fluxes and volatile transport within the first Myr under a wide range of stellar and disk properties.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program observes molecular emission and ice absorptions of 40 Class I/FS sources in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. All observations are obtained with MIRI-MRS across the full wavelength range, to observe molecular lines from abundant volatile species (e.g., H2O, H2, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, OH). We aim for SNRs of 100-200 at the 22micron and 300-500 at 15micron, to firmly detect known molecular tracers and have good constraints on optically thin lines. We will use the standard 4-dither pattern. Delicated background observations are requested to improve the calibration. To improve time efficiency, we use one background observations for each 3-6 closely located protostar sources together.
