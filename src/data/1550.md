## ABSTRACT

A well-characterized target within the LMC field will be placed on each subarray and each full-frame SCA to measure any count-rate differences between these different read-out modes. Every aperture (subarray and full) used for science or calibration must be assessed; this program includes only those that are not assessed in other Commissioning or Cycle 1 Calibration programs.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Includes FULL-to-Subarray flux transfers, including all subarrays used for science and flux calibration. Additional Module-to-Module and SCA-to-SCA are done in Commissioning.

COM-NRC-29 includes:
Module-to-Module,
SCA-to-SCA (both modules)
FULL-to-SUB*P

COM-NRC-21 includes:
Module-to-Module
SCA-to-SCA (both modules)
NRC_ALL-to-SUB160 (module B)

COM-NRC-32 includes:
GRISM NRC_ALL-to-SUBGRISM*

COM-NRC-21b includes:
Coronagraph FULL_A2-FULL_A4

Absflux Cycle 1 program includes:
Coronagraph SUB640-to-SUB640 (all SW masks)
Coronagraph SUB320-to-SUB320 (all LW masks)

This program includes:
Coronagraph NRCA_ALL-to-SUB640 (one SW mask)
Coronagraph NRCA_ALL-to-SUB320 (one LW mask) --> switched to SUB400x256 for SW+LW coronagraphy
Imaging SUB160-to-SUB* (all module B extended source subarrays)
Imaging SUB160-to SUB64P (module A)
Imaging SUB160[modB]-to-SUB160[modA] (module A)
Grism TS FULL-to-SUBGRISM* (moduleA)
Grism TS Nout1-to-Nout4 (on SUBGRISM128 only)

TIMING CONSTRAINTS: Group all of the observations in a non-interruptible sequence to avoid issues with variability. The Nout=1 to Nout=4 obs on SUBGRISM128 are tied in a separate non-inerruptible sequence.

TARGET CONSIDERATIONS: We might consider changing the target if the star chosen does not fall on the Astrometric obs due to unfavorable position angle. A target change might require additional observations since the target used here is used for flux transfers in other CAL/COM programs.
