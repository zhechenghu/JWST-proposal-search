## ABSTRACT
We request time to observe a sparse field to measure the WFSS background in the F090W filter. There are relatively few science observations in this filter for the WFSS mode, and those that are in the archive are of crowded fields not well suited to background measurements. The observation will allow a significant improvement in the WFSS F090W background reference files in the JWST pipeline.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The observation uses a field which has been observed by NIRISS in the imaging background programs 1475, 4443, and 6657. The point matches that of program 6657 observation 1, so we know that the field is clear of bright NIRISS sources that would pose a problem for the observation. To allow the removal of source spectra we use a 4x4 mosaic with 90% overlap in both directions. The offsets of about 200 pixels between the positions will allow removal of the source spectrra when the rate images are combined to make the background template image. The exposure time is similar to that in the imaging zodiacal background programs, since the signal level for the grisms should be similar to what is observed in the imaging case. For the F090W filter we expect of order 1.5 ADU/s signal in the ramps.
