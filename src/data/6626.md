## ABSTRACT

This program monitors the full-frame and subarray noise properties by taking dark observations throughout Cycle 3 using the equivalent of every readout pattern. The darks are set up to characterize the dark current, 1/f noise, IPC, cross-talk, and superbias. We note that the dark current itself is so low (1.9/27 e-/ks for the shortwave/longwave channel) that achieving a good S/N per pixel is prohibitive for the shortwave channel. However, hot pixels are still characterized, and the overall temporal evolution of the dark current can be monitored with the median of the full frame. Dark frames are particularly important for subarrays because of ‘glow' from the amplifiers, which accumulates each time a pixel is read out. Since subarrays have short frametimes, the glow accumulates much faster than it does in the full frame images. The glow may produce significant structure across subarrays, and is also expected to change if the ASICs are re-tuned. For this activity, the pupil wheels will be set to the “Dark” position. We will obtain 3 epochs of darks, with a similar cadence for the full-frame and subarray darks. For Cycle 3, we include 25 epochs of short full-frame darks for each module taken ~every two weeks to monitor the rate of new bad pixels.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

February 2024 A. Canipe

APT allows ramps as long as 4152s, but this program restricts the full-frame Darks to 150 frames/ramp (1605s) since we generally recommend keeping ramps ~<1500s. This will be revisited later if approved science programs in Cycle 3 require longer ramps. For FULL darks, the RAPID pattern with 150 groups can be used to reconstruct the BRIGHT1, BRIGHT2, SHALLOW2, SHALLOW4, MEDIUM2, and MEDIUM8 readout patterns since they all require <100 frames. To reconstruct the DEEP patterns, we have two options: (1) use RAPID with NGROUP=150 (to achieve DEEP2/8 with NGROUP=8, or 1520s/1583s), or (2) use DEEP2/8 with NGROUP=8 in addition to the RAPID-150 observations. The first option uses less time, the second option uses less data volume. This program is designed following the first option because, at the time of writing, the JWST pipeline requires dark reference files to be in RAPID. The large data volume in RAPID mode requires the modules (5 detectors each) to be observed separately. The DEEP patterns (if used) can be observed using both modules simultaneously. To construct a superbias, we require multiple integrations that we will build up over Cycle 3, while also monitoring read noise. We will aim for 6 full-frame ramps in each module to decrease the noise by including 3 sets throughout Cycle 3, each with 2 integrations.

For subarrays, we use the RAPID readout pattern with enough groups to reconstruct all readout patterns in a way that reflects the science usage for the subarray. The subarrays do not produce too much data volume to preclude using larger numbers of groups (e.g., NGROUP=100). The largest subarray produces only 4.4 GB per module/epoch, the smallest only 64 MB. To construct a superbias for subarrays, we use 7 to 10 total integrations that will be obtained in 3 epochs. By distributing these epochs throughout Cycle 3, we can monitor changes over time. For module A, we include subarrays for: SUBP, Grism TSO, and Coronagraphy. For module B, we include subarrays for: SUBP, SUBX (extended src), and Coronagraphy. Additional redundant subarrays (e.g., Grism subarrays on module B) exist, but won't be implemented unless there is a problem with the primary module. We do not include those here.

For Cycle 3, we include 25 new epochs of short full-frame darks (<15mins) for each module taken ~every two weeks to monitor the rate of new bad pixels. Based on observations in Cycle 2, the rate of new bad pixels is higher than expected, which has caused target acquisition failures for coronagraphic observations and required unexpected updates to the on-board flat files. By catching new bad pixels earlier in the process, we can more adequately plan for updates and minimize target acquisition failures during the cycle.

TIMING CONSTRAINTS: Darks should be repeated in order to see how the noise properties depend on telescope temperature, attitude, downlink activity, cross-talk during parallels, etc. The read noise has been stable, so we require monitoring on a ~2 month timescale to check stability. We are obtaining long darks in 3 epochs total to avoid issues with data volume. Additional epochs will be added if the darks do not prove to be stable. The short full-frame darks for bad pixel monitoring should be taken every ~2 weeks to allow us to catch new bad pixels and update the on-board flats, if needed, in order to avoid target acquisition failures.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.
