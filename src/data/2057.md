## ABSTRACT

The measurement of the scaling relations between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and the properties of the host galaxy at cosmic noon (z~2) is crucial to understanding the co-evolution (or not) of SMBHs and galaxies, the nature of AGN feedback and self-regulated BH growth, and the forecast for the stochastic gravitational wave background from mergers of SMBHs. Given the difficulties of acquiring both reliable BH masses and host galaxy measurements in this regime, there is currently no consensus on whether or not such correlations exist at z~2. We propose pioneering JWST NIRCam ~1-5 micron imaging and NIRSpec IFU ~1-2 micron spectroscopy to constrain the correlations between SMBH mass and host stellar velocity dispersion, stellar mass and luminosity, using a unique sample of ten z~2 quasars with BH masses measured directly from reverberation mapping. This pilot JWST program is poised to deliver the most definitive constraints on the high-z SMBH-galaxy scaling relations to date, paving the way for future more ambitious programs. It will also enable a broad range of science, from stellar populations of massive quasar host galaxies, to kpc-scale quasar-driven outflows (e.g., in [OIII]5007), and provide a benchmark sample for comparative studies of massive galaxies at z~2 (e.g., star-forming and quiescent galaxies, obscured AGN hosts, etc).

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will perform NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy for ten z~2 quasars with direct black hole mass estimates based on reverberation mapping. The NIRCam imaging is primarily used to measure morphology, local environment, and stellar populations of the hosts upon imaging decomposition in multiple bands. The NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy is primarily used to measure the stellar velocity dispersion and [O III] kinematic maps. The ten targets are all within a 1.5-deg-radius field so slew overhead is insignficant.

Each target will have two observations, and each observation can be fit in a single visit. All targets can be considered compact sources (with sizes <1") in sparse extragalactic fields. All targets are relatively bright, with average J-band magnitude of 19.2 (Vega).

The first visit/observation is NIRCam imaging in two pairs of short+long-wave filters (F090W+F277W, F150W+F444W). We will use the SUB640 subarray and offset the target to avoid the central detector gaps. For each filter combination, we will adopt a 4-point STANDARD subpixel dither pattern and a total exposure time of ~480 or ~320 sec. This dither pattern is sufficient to reach Nyquist sampling of the PSF for all filters but F090W, whose PSF is still slightly undersampled. This compromise is acceptable since the F090W filter samples the rest-frame UV and is not primarily used for morphological measurements and stellar mass estimation. Increasing the number of dither points will lead to substantial extra overhead with minimal improvements for our primary science goals. We will use field stars in all NIRCam pointings for the ten targets to construct a composite PSF reference for our quasar/host decomposition.

The second visit/observation is the NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy. We will use the G140M/F100LP setup. No PSF subtraction is required for the IFU observations. No instrument-level target acquisition is required given the compact sizes of our targets and the pointing accuracy. We will use a 4-point dither pattern with a total exposure time of ~2400 sec. For each visit we will include a WAVECAL exposure. The sky background can be considered uniform for our targets and the background level is sufficiently low for our targets, therefore MSA leakage is not important (only mild fractional increase in background level) and we do not require a separate MSA leakcal exposure. We will manually process the dithered exposures for background subtraction if necessary.
