## ABSTRACT

Actively accreting supermassive black holes (AGN) can have significant impact on the evolution of their host galaxies through feedback in the form of gas winds and radio jets which can be seen on kpc scale, encompassing the entire galaxy. We propose here to determine the impact of powerful AGN on their host galaxies at Cosmic Noon where the co-moving density of luminous AGN is at its peak. Our sample consists of high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs), the only AGN population, in which quasar-mode feedback, radio-mode feedback and the host galaxies can be characterised simultaneously. We will use the JWST to 'zoom into' some of the most massive and active galaxies at the onset of the peak of star-formation and AGN activity to address the long-standing question on how exactly AGN-driven outflows propagate into the host galaxy and how small-scale phenomena close to the central engine reflect on the large-scale jet and gas characteristics. The diffraction-limited resolution of JWST and two-dimensional coverage with NIRSpec IFU will provide a 10-fold improvement in resolution over existing observations and will allow us to map the stellar, gas, and excitation components of distant HzRGs all at once for the first time. It is critically important to compare local AGN with what happens near the start of the peak of the cosmic star formation rate density at comparable sub-kpc scale resolution, and with exactly the same diagnostics. Our sample at the “sweet spot” redshift ~3.5 is uniquely suited to do this, covering the critical wavelength regime between [OII] and H-alpha even including [SII] in just one spectral setting with the NIRSpec G235H/F170LP.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will be observing four high-redshift radio galaxies at z ~ 3.5 using the NIRSpec IFUs. The main goal is to spatially map the emission lines from [OII] to H-alpha and [SII] that are all covered in just one spectral setting (G235H/170LP).
