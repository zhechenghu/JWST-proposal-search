## ABSTRACT

The purpose of this activity is to measure count-rate linearity in the FULL frame, and in all science and calibration subarrays. The program requires observations of a rich stellar field that is bright and dense down to the confusion limit. The goal is to probe the linearity of a large sample of pixels across the detector/subarray by exposing in RAPID mode up to saturation. This program will target the LMC calibration field, which is in the CVZ. Observations between the FULL frame and the subarrays are set at the same field point to ensure the same stars are detected at the same spots on the detector.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

TARGET: Bright stars in the LMC Calibration field

EXPOSURE SETUP: RAPID, with groups set to achieve at least 600 second exposures, except for SUB64P, which can't reach that depth (max is 5000 groups).

DITHERS/MOSAIC: No dithers or mosaics - detector should remain at the same spot between exposures.

SUBARRAYS/DETECTORS: We are using all science and calibration subarrays, plus the FULL frames.

TIMING REQUIREMENTS: We link all mod-A observations as noninterruptible. Same for mod-B observations. We want no/minimal movement between observations.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: We use fiducial point overrides to keep the detectors at the same position for each exposure.
