## ABSTRACT

This Planetary Nebula is shedding its outer layers. Being a very close planetary nebulae, it offers the opportunity to view out expanding material at the highest possible spatial resolution. Existing Hubble images have revealed that the shell consists of a multitude of cometary knots. This proposal will create a landscape "vista” of the edge of the shell, revealing the transition from ionized gas, to cometary knots and molecular gas in an entirely new light.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal will use the NIRCam imaging mode to obtain multi-band imaging of a planetary nebula. The images must be sufficiently deep to allow for the creation of low-noise color composite images. The dither patterns are optimized for uniform depth, efficient removal of cosmic rays and other artifacts, and high-quality subsampling of the point spread function (PSF). These criteria will also produce very high-quality, science-ready data products for use by the community. This proposal does not include spectroscopic observations.
