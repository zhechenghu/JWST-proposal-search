## ABSTRACT

Winds powered by radiation from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to critically affect galaxy evolution. The fate of molecular gas in such outflows is one of the most important unsolved questions in galaxy evolution: if we find that winds can entrain, reheat or remove molecular gas from galaxies we will prove that AGN can quench star formation in its host galaxy and enable the first studies of this key stage of AGN feedback. However, despite years of searches with ground-based telescopes, only a few molecular outflows are known among AGN in the local universe. Here we propose MIRI and NIRSpec IFU observations to spatially resolve the molecular gas kinematics in the three most promising hosts of strong molecular outflows identified from Spitzer and SDSS spectroscopy. These observations will be used in a detailed investigation to reveal if the molecular gas demonstrates the kinematics commensurate with the wind hypothesis. Furthermore, the JWST data will allow the first in-depth studies of the impact of the AGN on the molecular gas in their hosts.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will be observing three local Universe AGN host galaxies using a combination of NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. The targets were selected as being very promissing hosts of strong molecular outflows. The warm gas phase will be observed through MIR H2 emission lines, while the hot phase is traced by the NIR H2 emission. Several emission lines from ionized gas will be used to trace the ionized outflows, which will allow us to characterize the multi-phase outflows.

The following observing modes per object are:
