## ABSTRACT
    This cloud complex is a nearby star-forming region approximately 520 light years away and hosts several proto-stellar jets. The Spitzer image reveals the outflow from a protostar that lies beyond the top edge of the field of view. The protostellar jet creates shocks as it plows through the nearby gas and dust. The JWST image will reveal new intricate details of the infrared color gradient along the jet axis.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
    This proposal will use the NIRCam and MIRI imaging modes to obtain multi-band imaging to be released in 2024. The images must be sufficiently deep to allow for the creation of low-noise color-composite images. The dither patterns are optimized for uniform depth, efficient removal of cosmic rays and other artifacts. These criteria will also produce very high-quality, science-ready data products for use by the community. This proposal does not include spectroscopic observations.
