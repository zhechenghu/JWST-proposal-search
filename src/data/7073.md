## ABSTRACT

Measuring the prevalence and diversity of M-dwarf rocky exoplanet atmospheres stands to be one of JWST's lasting legacies. However, the detection of secondary atmospheres remains elusive. In hindsight, this should not come as a surprise, since none of the rocky planet transit observations to date are sensitive to Earth-like (i.e., N2-rich) atmospheres. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of these planets are not expected to have atmospheres based on solar system trends. Coined the "cosmic shoreline," this hypothesized trend stems from an empirical division between bodies with and without atmospheres, yet early JWST measurements imply a strong stellar dependence to the cosmic shoreline when extended down to M-dwarf systems. Thus, we are at an inflection point where, despite past investments, many questions remain unanswered: (1) Do temperate M-dwarf rocky planets possess high mean molecular weight atmospheres? (2) Where is the cosmic shoreline located within a given multi-planet system? (3) How does the presence of atmospheres correlate with stellar type?

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We proposed to observe six rocky exoplanets from three multi-planet, M-dwarf systems (LTT 1445A, LHS 1140, and LP 890-9).

By obtaining multiple transits per planet with NIRISS SOSS and/or NIRSpec G395/PRISM, we will have the sensitivity and wavelength coverage to detect absorption from H2O, CH4, and CO2 in multiple bands. Our brightest system (LTT 1445A) will use the SUBSTRIP96 subarray to mitigate saturation and, thus, will only capture Order 1 (0.8 -- 2.8 microns). LHS 1140 will use the SUBSTRIP256 subarray to capture both Orders 1 and 2 (0.6 - 2.8 microns). The faintest system (LP 890-9) will use NIRSpec PRISM.

We've used PandExo to optimize the number of groups and integrations for each planet in such a way that maximized SNR and avoids saturation. Phase constraints ensure that we will monitor the system before, during, and after each transit/eclipse event. For systems using the NIRISS instrument, we apply position angle (PA) constraints to avoid contamination from neighboring stars. We will work with STScI to find a suitable TA star for LTT 1445A or use blind pointing for those observations.
