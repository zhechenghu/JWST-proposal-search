## ABSTRACT

This program will observe CALSPEC stars of appropriate brightness in each MIRI filter (imaging and coronagraphic imaging) in order to construct low-frequency flatfield (L-flat) reference files. The CALSPEC stars will be observed in 25 different locations across the imager field-of-view and 4 different locations across the Lyot region in each imaging and coronagraphic imaging filter. 4 positions across each 4QPM will be observed in each corresponding coronagraphic imaging filter. Variations in star brightness across the detector will be used to construct the L-flat for each filter, complementing the pixel-to-pixel flats (P-flats) already in use in the pipeline.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The goal of this program is to compute the low-frequency flat field (L-flat) for the MIRI imaging detector. This will be achieved by placing a CALSPEC standard star of appropriate brightness in 25 points across the MIRI imager FOV and 4 points across the Lyot region for every filter (including coronagraphic filters). Additional observations are included to place CALSPEC stars in 4 points across each of the three 4QPMs, using only the corresponding coronagraphic filter for each 4QPM. All observations with a given filter are in a non-interruptible group to prevent changes in thermal background from affecting the measurements.
