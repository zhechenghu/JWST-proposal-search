## ABSTRACT

Episodes of luminous quasar activity are directly related to supermassive black hole growth. The ionizing radiation emitted over a quasar's lifetime alters the ionization state of the surrounding intergalactic medium, enhancing the Lya forest transmission, which can be observed in absorption spectra of background sources. We propose a new technique to photometrically map these quasar light echoes through Lya forest tomography, using high-redshift [OIII] emitter galaxies selected via NIRCam/WFSS with the F356W filter. By measuring their UV continua with the NIRCam F115W and F200W filters, and existing Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging, one can measure the Lya forest transmission in the vicinity of a foreground quasar. In this proposal, we request NIRCam/WFSS observations to measure Lya forest transmission values in the vicinity of a foreground quasar at z~5.7, towards efficiently selected background [OIII] emitters at z~5.8-7.0. This program will allow for unprecedented constraints of the quasar emission geometry, providing a new window for studying SMBH growth.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal targets the J0001+2650 quasar field with the goal of identifying [OIII] emitters in the redshift range 5.3 < z < 7 using the NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) mode. We will perform a 10-pointing mosaic using the F356W filter to detect [OIII] emitters and simultaneously capture the UV continua of background galaxies using the F115W and F200W filters. The mosaic layout consists of pointings centered on both the quasar and nearby Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) identified in prior observations. This approach ensures broad coverage of the quasar's vicinity, where the light-echo signal is expected to be strongest, while also covering the regions where measurements along background LAEs are available.

We will use Grism R to minimize overheads while ensuring sufficient sensitivity to detect the expected [OIII] emission lines. The total exposure time for WFSS+F356W is 1800 seconds, split across 9 groups per integration, with four dithers using the SHALLOW4 readout and a two-point primary dither pattern. The F115W filter will be used for simultaneous short-wavelength imaging, while F200W imaging will help constrain the UV continuum shapes of the background galaxies. In total, the observation requires 9.2 hours of science time, with a total of 17.3 hours requested when including overheads.
