## ABSTRACT

This program provides additonal data for the MOS S-flat (spectroscopic flat field) reference files. The MOS S-flat is a cube with complete but sparse sampling in wavelength space per pixel. This allows the calibration of MOS spectra, regardless of the location of the MSA shutters used. Data will be obtained through 56 MSA long slit configurations using the CAA internal calibration FLAT lamps to improve the wavelength sampling of the reference files. The S-flat is one part of the 3-component NIRSpec flat field: the F-flat traces the field-dependent throughput of the OTE and instrument FORE optics, the S-flat traces the light path from the micro-shutter array up to but not including the FPA, and the D-flat consists of the pixel-to-pixel variations of the detector.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This spectroscopic flats program executes 45 MOS long slit flat lamp observations to improve the wavelength interpolation of the MOS spectroscopic flats. Existing data from Commissioning and cycle 3 provide complete but sparse coverage of the possible shutter configurations.
The internal CAA will be used to provide the appropriate flat illumination for each of seven dispersers. The MSA will be configured with 37 unique long slits to be observed with the FLAT1-3 lamps plus their corresponding dispersers, and an additional 8 long slits to be observed with FLAT5+PRISM. Each visit contains 4 or 5 of the 37 long slits with a single grating, to help minimize mechanism usage. A single visit contains all 8 PRISM long slits, with each exposure using 2 slits with sufficient separation to prevent spectral overlap. One lamp exposure with the MSA ALLCLOSED configuration will be also be obtained in each visit in order to subtract the leakage signal.
The execution sequence for this activity, 1) minimizes mechanism usage, and 2) complies with GWA rule for leakage exposures and 3) attempts to minimize execution time by scheduling during slews, even though this dramatically increases overhead time.
