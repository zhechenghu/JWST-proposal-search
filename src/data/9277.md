## ABSTRACT

This program executes successive rotations of the GWA (grating wheel assembly), one position at a time, with an internal lamp exposure taken at each position (LINE4 for the PRISM, REF for the gratings). The data will enable monitoring of the calibration of the GWA tilt sensors, which is a critical part of the NIRSpec wavelength calibration. This calibration is part of the NIRSpec instrument model, but the tilt sensors are more likely to change with time than the other internal instrument model components and will be monitored more frequently. The monitor will run approximately once every 4 weeks to provide data on the GWA tilt behavior and build up statistics for a full tilt calibration if necessary. See APT file proposal description section for more detailed information. This Cycle 4 program is essentially identical to the structure of the Cycle 3 program 6638 and to that of the Cycle 2 program 4463, which had implemented a new and more efficient scheduling structure that was developed part way through the execution of the Cycle 1 program (1491).

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The exposures taken at each GWA position are very short (1.5-3 minutes); in order to be able to fit observations into slews, we have split an individual rotation set into three observations, each with two or three wheel positions (obs 1: PRISM/LINE4, G395M/REF, G235M/REF; obs 2: G140M/REF, G395H/REF; obs 3: G235H/REF, G140H/REF). We added a timing requirement so that each set of three observations is taken within a 48-hour period (revised from 24-hours after early Cycle 1 experience provided a better understanding of the typical frequency and length of slews). This new structure worked well in Cycles 2 and 3 and will be continued in Cycle 4 with no changes apart from actual date ranges appropriate to Cycle 4.

Thirteen observation sets are included in the program. Each observation set or observing epoch is constrained to be scheduled within a 4-week period via BETWEEN special requirements (SR).
The individual observation sets, which are all conducted as slew parallels, are required to complete within 2 days.via GROUP WITHIN SR and all members of a set also are required to execute within the same BETWEEN interval.
