## ABSTRACT

Small rocky planets are now known to be very frequent in temperate orbits around low-mass M-dwarfs. The most pressing question regarding these ubiquitous planets concerns their capacity to maintain significant secondary atmospheres despite the adverse environment (high XUV fluxes, winds) and history (long pre-main-sequence) brought by their small host stars. Here, we propose to use MIRI to determine unambigously if the two inner planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system are bare rocks or not by complementing the Cycle 1 measurements of their daysides' thermal emission at 15microns with the observation of their combined thermal phase curve. The presence of an atmosphere around at least one of the two planets would not only be a very encouraging prospect for the presence of atmospheres around the five cooler outer planets of the system, but it would also represent a critical step in the study of M-dwarfs' rocky planets and their potential habitability.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The program consists in a 57.7hr-long continuous TSO observation of TRAPPIST-1 with MIRI/imaging within the F1500W filter, without any dither to keep the star's PSF on the same pixels, using the FASTR1 read-out mode and the MIRI BRIGHTSKY array. It is divided in two visits, one composed of one exposure of 3473 integrations of 45 groups each, and the other composed of one exposure of 1863 integrations of 45 groups each.
