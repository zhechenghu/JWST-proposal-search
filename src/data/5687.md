## ABSTRACT

Eclipse mapping is currently the only method capable of measuring 2D (latitude-longitude) profiles of exoplanet atmospheres. The method has been used to accurately map the longitudinal profiles of a handful of exoplanets, allowing us to characterise their atmospheric dynamics using key tracers such as the longitudinal offset of the hotspot (the hottest point on the planet) due to supersonic jets. However, no exoplanet has yet been adequately mapped in latitude because there is a limited parameter space in which we are capable of observing such signals. Latitudinal hotspot offsets can be induced by a marginal misalignment between the magnetic field of an exoplanet and its spin axis, with the scale of the offset related to the field strength and angle of misalignment. Characterising this offset would thus allow us to probe these parameters for planetary-mass objects for the first time, which is only possible via eclipse mapping because it is the only method capable of mapping these objects in latitude as well as longitude.
KELT-8b's 1675 K equilibrium temperature make it ideally susceptible to a magnetically-induced latitudinal hotspot offset, and its 0.741 impact parameter and 45 minute ingress/egress duration make this offset optimally observable. We will use MIRI/LRS to observe two eclipses of KELT-8b, using a unique observing strategy designed to give the best constraints on both its longitudinal and latitudinal profile. This will allow us to construct the most informative eclipse map of an exoplanet to date, from which we will be able to extract a wealth of information, including the atmospheric dynamics, heat redistribution, wind speeds, and magnetic field geometry.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe two eclipses of KELT-8b using MIRI/LRS in Slitless Prism mode to obtain 5-12 micron light curves and spectra. The planet-star flux ratio peaks in the mid-infrared, therefore we will achieve the best signal-to-noise (SNR) in this bandpass. The LRS instrument gives us the highest white light curve precision, which is required to recover the small-scale eclipse mapping signals, and the highest cadence of 13.6773 s, which gives us good spatial scanning of the dayside atmosphere, making its use optimal over that of the MIRI photometric filters.
Each observation will have 85 groups per integration. The shorter observation will consist of two exposures, each comprising 948 integrations (totalling 1896), covering the eclipse duration of 3.466 hours, with 2.487 hours of pre-eclipse baseline and 1.250 hours of post-eclipse baseline to characterise the baseline stellar and planetary flux and instrumental ramp effects. This observation totals 25932.108 s (7.203 hours) of exposure time. The longer observation will also consist of two exposures, but comprising 1641 integrations each (totalling 3282), with the added time given to the 7.750 hours of pre-eclipse baseline in order to measure the phase signal associated with the longitudinal hotspot offset. This observation totals 44889.04 s (12.468 hours) of exposure time. Together, the two observations total 19.44 hours of science time, and 19.671 hours of exposure time when accounting for instrumental overheads. When also including observatory overheads, this results in a total charged time of 24.97 hours.
Each time series observation must occur during, and cover a full secondary eclipse event of KELT-8b, and therefore must begin within a specified phase window of the orbital period. We have specified a 1 hour window during which the observation can begin to allow for scheduling and the appropriate baseline. We additionally include a series of Aperture PA ranges to ensure that our observations are free of contamination from nearby stars. There are multiple opportunities in Cycle 3 to conduct the proposed observations.
We will perform target acquisition on our target star using the F560W filter and FAST readout pattern with 10 groups. Using the JWST Exposure Time Calculator, we estimate that this will achieve an SNR of 379, which will be sufficient to acquire our target.
