## ABSTRACT

We propose NIRCAM, NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS observations of the integral shaped filament (ISF): a 6000 Msun, 8 pc long, massive filament at 390 pc containing the Orion Nebula. We focus on the OMC2/3 region north of the nebula. Illuminated by UV radiation from the nearby OB stars, OMC2/3 is the most active region of low mass star formation in the ISF with 46 protostars. IFU 2.9-29 mu observations of the 13 Class 0 protostars will trace the mass flows in jets and wide-angle winds in shock heated atomic, ionic and molecular species that will trace how jets and winds interact with the infalling gas and shape the IMF. These observations will be extended by NIRCam from 1000 au to parsec scales, including all 46 protostars, to examine how outflows from all stages of protostellar evolution inject momentum and energy into their environment and regulate star formation. IFU and prism spectra will show the compositions of ices in the envelopes of Class 0 protostars, elucidating the formation of organic molecules in clouds near OB stars, and illuminating the role of external UV photons on the initial chemistry of planet formation. Finally, the data will be used to examine accretion onto protostars using multiple tracers: HI lines, OH lines, and ices thermally processed by accretion driven outbursts. These data will determine typical rates of mass accretion during the primary accretion (Class 0) phase, establish the fraction of gas launched in outflows, and assess the importance of outbursts in mass assembly. Building on an extensive, existing observations, JWST will provide crucial observations of this essential region that cannot be obtained by any facility in the foreseeable future.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

**NIRCam:** we will maps seven fields. The roll angle is limited for Orion, but we have set a specific angle to ensure coverage of the targeted protostars. This can be relaxed if we are able to tweak the field centers before observations. At each position we obtain 5 tight dithers in a FULLBOX mode. At each point we obtain 8 group exposure in F212N and F470N (to get H2 lines), F184N and F360M (to get Paschen alpha and continuum) and F210M and F480M (to get continuum and CO). These use the Bright1 or Bright2 readout modes.

**NIRSpec IFU:** we will target 13 Class 0 protostars using 2x2 maps with 4 dithers. We will use the G395M to get spectra with the resolution to detect and isolate emission lines and the prism to get a low resolution spectrum that can be used to measure the ice features at 3 microns. We adjust the number of groups in each to obtain S/N of ~30 estimated with the ETC. No leakcal are requested.

**MIRI-MRS:** we will again target 13 Class 0 protostars using 2x2 maps with 4 dithers. We will use all channels and sub-bands. Using Spitzer spectra and the ETC, we have estimated the time needed to achieve S/N ~ 20/25. We will obtain backgrounds with the same times and two dithers. We group these in non-interruptible sequences with 2-3 protostars for maximum efficiency.
