## ABSTRACT

An obscured phase in the accretion history of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is widely thought to represent a key step in the co-evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. While models of the Cosmic X-ray Background have shown that the most obscured, Compton-thick (CT) AGN (those with N(H) >1E24 cm^-2) are expected to comprise up to 50% of the AGN population, they are extremely hard to detect and identify. Most of the CT AGN we know at low redshift are located within 100 Mpc, and we still lack a clear understanding of the properties of their circumnuclear material, star formation, and the impact of AGN feedback on the host galaxy. We propose here to obtain JWST/MIRI observations of 13 nearby, hard X-ray selected CT AGN to obtain resolved mid-infrared spectra and images of their circumnuclear, multi-phase ISM. By studying this sample with MIRI and applying the suite of powerful mid-infrared diagnostics to these elusive galaxies, we can simultaneously measure the SMBH accretion rates, star formation rates, warm molecular gas masses and temperatures and map the excitation and dynamics of the ionized atomic gas on scales of < 100pc for the first time. These data will also allow us to measure the spatially resolved properties of the dust in absorption and emission, providing the first detailed infrared maps of the obscuring material around CT AGN. Our proposed survey will advance our understanding of this critical phase of SMBH growth, be invaluable for understanding high-redshift obscured AGN discovered with JWST, and set the stage for large area surveys to be done in the coming decade with the next generation of X-ray and Far-Infrared probes.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

**Spatially Resolved Spectroscopy:** We will observe all 13 targets with the MIRI IFUs, using the MRS over the full wavelength range. We use a single IFU pointing, centered on the nucleus, for each source. We have very accurate infrared and radio positions for every nucleus, so we have not included target acquisition imaging, since the current estimates of the JWST blind pointing are sufficient to center the nuclei in each of the IFUs. We employ a 4-pt on-source dither pattern for MIRI MRS with a separate dedicated off-source background to recover the extended emission around each nucleus. Background positions have been selected to avoid extended emission from the galactic disks, nearby galaxies, or stars. To save time and overhead, the background exposures use identical groups and integrations, but with a 2-pt dither pattern. We use the FASTR1 readout pattern in all cases to avoid saturating the nuclei. To minimize overheads, we chose to use the same exposure times for all of the MRS dispersers (Short, Medium, and Long).

**Imaging:** We have included dedicated imaging in the MIRI F560W, F770W, and F1500W filters for each source. In most cases, the FoV of MIRI is large enough to include a significant fraction of the galactic disk, and in some cases, the entire galaxy, in a single pointing. For each source we have selected the maximum number of groups in order to avoid saturating the nuclei while still obtaining long enough exposures to detect faint structures. NGC 5643 has broad band, full-array MIRI imaging in program 3707. Here, we request sub-array imaging to recover the flux from the saturated nucleus and properly register the MIRI IFU data, along with MIRI/MRS spectroscopy, which is not part of program 3707. For the MIRI imaging we are using 7 groups and taking multiple integrations (5 to 15) per position to best match the spectroscopic exposure times (for the simultaneous imaging) and the brightness of each source. We expect to achieve a SNR > 10 to 20 for a 10 Jy point source (the brightness of the faintest star-forming clumps we expect in the disks, based on existing mid-infrared imaging and results from the published NGC 7469 images and spectra). We use BRIGHTSKY array mode for all of our MIRI imaging and a cycling, 3-position dither. For each source, we have also added dedicated MIRI SUB128 sub-array images with 8 to 12 groups and 10 to 15 integrations, to ensure we can obtain reliable fluxes and colors for the AGN nuclei and immediate surroundings in the advent that the nuclei saturate in the full-array images (although modeling with a point source plus Sersic profile disk in the MIRI ETC suggests this should not happen for our targets).
