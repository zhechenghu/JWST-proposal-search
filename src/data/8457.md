## ABSTRACT

Super-Eddington accretion is a crucial yet poorly understood phase in the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), key to explaining the rapid formation of the first SMBHs. Despite its importance, the mechanisms driving these extreme accretion events remain unclear. Using JWST's MIRI and NIRSpec instruments, we will conduct the first systematic infrared study of a well-defined sample of nearby hyper-Eddington AGN, with black hole masses estimated through a dedicated reverberation mapping campaign. These observations will provide spatially resolved emission line distributions, kinematics, and detailed maps of PAH and dust, while probing extreme UV emission through coronal lines. This will allow us to measure accretion rates, star formation, gas dynamics, and detect outflows on scales of 60–200 pc. Combined with existing X-ray and optical/near UV data, we will gain key insights into super-Eddington accretion flows and their impact on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This study will address fundamental questions about SMBH evolution and its role in cosmic reionization, offering strong legacy value for AGN, galaxy evolution, and stellar feedback studies.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request observations of the nuclear regions of five super-Eddington AGN using NIRSpec with the grating/filters: G394H/F290LP (2.9–5.1 microns) and G235H/F170LP (1.66-3.17microns), together with the full 4.9–28.5 microns range using all the 4 channels on the MIRI/MRS. We will use a 4-point dither pattern for the galaxy observations and obtain the recommended 2-point dither background observation for each target for MIRI/MRS. We do not restrict the PA of the background observations. As our targets fit within the NIRSpec FOV, we can perform background subtraction within the FOV. To avoid saturation, we will use NRSRAPID and FASTR1 readout pattern mode for NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS, respectively.

For NIRSpec we will use between 3-5 groups and 8-4 integrations for each dither point, while for MIRI/MRS we will use between 65 and 100 groups and 1 integration for each dither point. Additionally, in the case of MIRI/MRS observation we will obtain simultaneous observations with MIRI/MIRIM using three filters, namely, F560W, F770W, and F1130W. We used the SUB256 imager field to avoid saturating the bright nucleus, centering on the AGN. Finally, we require one integration of the same number of groups for each NIRSpec observation to ensure leakage corrections.
