## ABSTRACT
"This activity monitors NIRCam's distortion and global alignment by visiting the LMC Calibration Field in both imaging and coronagraph imaging. The data will be used to determine the plate scale, orientation, and geometric distortion for each SCA in each NIRCam module over the full wavelength range. These observations use a combination of dithers and mosaics to overlap all SCAs onto the same location within the LMC. For all observations, we use a subset of the available filters and observe with FGS in parallel."

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
"EXPOSURE SETUP: We use readout patterns and groups/ints appropriate for a broad dynamic range of LMC stars, as demonstrated by Commissioning and Cycle 1 observations of the LMC Calibration field.
DITHERS: We include 2 INTRAMODULEBOX dithers for imaging and 7 INTRASCA 24" dithers for coronagraphy
MOSAIC: We include mosaics that place each SCA at the same location in the LMC
FGS is in parallel for all observations
OFFSETS: We include target offsets to help overlap all SCAs
TIMING CONSTRAINTS: We set a BETWEEN special requirement to observe this program in the first third of Cycle 2, about 6 months after the latest Cycle 1 observations."
