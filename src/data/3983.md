## ABSTRACT

The timescale of gas evolution in protoplanetary disks is critical in understanding planet formation. Photoevaporation is considered the dominant mechanism in removing gas from the disk and ultimately determines the disk's lifetime. Photoevaporation models predict different mass loss rates depending on whether the high-energy radiation from the star is dominated by X-ray, EUV, or FUV photons. One of the issues in distinguishing between photoevaporation models is the uncertainty in the level of high-energy radiation that the disk receives from the star. While X-ray and FUV radiation from the star can be measured, the EUV radiation cannot be observed directly due to interstellar absorption. We propose to use MIRI MRS to measure the [Ne II] and [Ne III] lines in 18 T Tauri disks accreting at very low rates. The low mass accretion rates suggest that their disks are actively dissipating, and these rates are consistent with models of EUV photoevaporation. The ratio of these Neon lines can be used to distinguish between different photoevaporation models and test if these disks are indeed undergoing EUV photoevaporation, making this study a definitive test of EUV photoevaporation models.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request to observe 18 protoplanetary disks using MIRI MRS in all channels. Our lines of interest are the [Ne II] 12.8 micron and [Ne III] 15.5 micron lines in MRS Channel 3, so the exposure time calculation is optimized for this channel. Using previous IRS observations of 4 of our targets, we scaled the spectra to the WISE W3 of the targets to estimate the exposure time required for SNR~50 at the continuum near the [Ne II] and [Ne III] lines. This is sufficient to detect the [Ne III] line, which can be faint. For bright targets with W3 < 8.5, we request target acquisitions with 4 groups/integration using the FND filter. We request the F1500W with the same setup for the rest of the targets. The proceeding observation sequence is the same for all targets. We will use the 4-point dithering in the negative direction, the FASTR1 readout with the full subarray, and 1 integration/exposure and 1 exposure/dithering position. The number of groups depends on the targets, ranging from 10 to 150 groups/integration. Since these targets are essentially point sources, Nod-in-Scene is sufficient to achieve our science goals.
