## ABSTRACT

JWST has revealed a previously unknown population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early universe, raising questions about the abundance of supermassive black holes in the epoch of reionization and the typical growth mechanisms and seed populations. These "little red dots" may represent a transition phase from obscured, rapidly accreting BH seeds to unobscured, blue quasars, but the properties of the AGN and their host galaxies remain unclear. LRDs generally do not exhibit common AGN signatures, and some may be dominated by host galaxy emission. We propose an efficient and comprehensive NIRSpec follow-up program targeting LRDs, obtaining uniform PRISM+G395M spectroscopy for ~100 of the brightest and highest-redshift LRDs discovered by JWST, particularly those with MIRI coverage at >10 micron. With these data we will be able to disentangle the heterogeneous LRD population and:
1) Search for outflows and high-ionization lines to determine the nature of LRD obscuration
2) Measure black hole and stellar masses and examine implications for LCDM and BH seeding scenarios
3) Measure number densities of LRDs with secure redshifts, and bolometric luminosities over a large volume
The proposed data will facilitate comprehensive analysis of the LRDs as a population, cross-correlating various observables to test key predictions from different interpretations, providing valuable insight into their role in early galaxy/SMBH growth.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The goal of this program is to obtain uniform spectroscopy of a large sample of LRDs at z~4-9. We will do so using NIRSpec in MOS mode with the PRISM/CLEAR and G395M/F290LP gratings. The PRISM covers a wavelength range from 0.6-5.3 micron at a resolution of R~100, allowing detection of faint lines and continuum features. G395M covers a wavelength range from 2.87-5.10 micron at a resolution of R~1000, allowing detections of broad Ha/Hb lines across a wide redshift range. We draw our targets from a parent sample of LRDs constructed from the union of published photometric samples across COSMOS, UDS, EGS, and GOODS-S, and assign target priority based on the colors/magnitudes/redshifts, prioritizing the brightest, reddest, and highest-redshift sources. The proposed MSA configurations yield a total of 175 LRD targets on slits, including 100 highest priority targets, with an average of ~8 per mask. We will also obtain spectra for ~4000 filler targets, which will be selected from samples of high-redshift galaxies/AGN to maximize the legacy value of the program.
For the PRISM we will observe with 24 groups of 1 integration with 3 nod in slit exposures and a NRSIRS2readout pattern, resulting in a total exposure time of 1.5 hr per pointing. We expect to detect continuum down to 27.4 AB mag (5sigma) and faint lines down to ~1e-18 erg/s/cm2/A (3sigma) with the PRISM. For G395M we use 15 groups of 1 integrations with 3 nod in slit exposures, for an exposure time of 55mins, which we expect to allow detection of broad Ha/Hb down to MBH~3e6 Msun.
