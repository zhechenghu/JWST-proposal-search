## ABSTRACT

Interstellar dust grains vitally affect the cooling and heating of the ISM and molecule formation. Understanding grain composition and structure in distant galaxies is therefore crucial for understanding the cosmic star formation history. A robust understanding of dust in distant galaxies is also needed to accurately correct for dust extinction effects on background objects. Unfortunately, grain properties in distant galaxies are poorly constrained. We propose to measure grain composition and structure in the diffuse ISM of galaxies at 0.1<z<1.1 with MIRI MRS spectroscopy of background quasars whose UV/optical spectra show signs of significant dust in the intervening galaxies: strong 2175 A bumps, reddening, and/or element depletion. The proposed MRS spectra will target redshifted features of silicates (10, 18 micron), hydrocarbons (3.4 micron), and PAHs (3.3-11.3 micron). Our main science goals are to investigate: (1) the silicate mineralogy and grain structure; (2) how Si, Fe depletions in the gas phase relate to silicate dust abundance; (3) whether carriers of various carbonaceous dust features are related; and (4) how dust properties are related to other galaxy properties. Only JWST MIRI has the powerful combination of the wavelength coverage, high sensitivity, and high spectral resolution crucial for measuring the mid-IR features of interest in the distant galaxies.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will obtain MIRI MRS spectra spanning 4.9-27.9 microns for our targets. We will also obtain dedicated background observations for each field. Further details are provided in the technical justification in the pdf attachment.
