## ABSTRACT

Interstellar dust influences the physics of the gas in galaxies because it affects cooling and molecule formation. Understanding the nature of interstellar dust in galaxies is thus crucial for understanding the evolution of gas and stars in galaxies. Unfortunately, the composition and stucture of dust grains in distant galaxies is not well understood. Recently a number of gas-rich galaxies with strong 2175 A bumps have been discovered in absorption along the lines of sight to distant quasars. Here we propose a JWST MIRI spectroscopic study of 8 such gas-rich and dusty galaxies at redshifts 0.5 <z< 1.2 for the first comprehensive study of dust composition in these distant galaxies. The proposed MRS spectra will target the 10 micron silicate absorption feature, the 3.4 micron hydrocarbon absorption feature, and the 3.1 micron water ice absorption feature. Our scientific goals are: (1) to examine whether the presence of the 2175 A bump is correlated with the presence of 10 micron silicate absorption, and whether any trends exist between the abundances of silicate and carbonaceous grains; (2) to determine the composition of silicate grains; (3) to investigate whether the carrier for the 2175 A bump is related to that for the 3.4 micron feature; and (4) to examine whether enough O can be locked up in H2O ice in these galaxies to address the "missing oxygen problem" for dust grains. JWST MIRI alone can provide the necessary combination of mid-IR wavelength coverage, exquisite sensitivity, and spectral resolution essential for efficiently observing the desired mid-IR dust features in the proposed sample of distant galaxies located along the sight lines to quasars.
