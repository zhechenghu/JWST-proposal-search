## ABSTRACT

A series of exposures of a single star with sub-pixel offsets will be used to characterize the variations in the AMI PSF with the position of the star within the pixel.
This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

An observation of an isolated single bright star will be carried out in the NIRISS AMI mode with a series of sub-pixel dithers. The combined set of observations will characterize the changes in the PSF as a function of where the star is positioned relative to the pixel center.
No phase calibration observation is required for this special calibration.
Two possible targets are provided for flexibility. Only one of the two needs to be observed. Both are continuously visible.
