## ABSTRACT

We propose a NIRCam coronagraphic program to discover wide-separation exoplanets and faint debris disks around an unexplored sample of 22 very nearby (d < 10pc) M-dwarf stars with fast stellar rotation rates indicative of youth (ages < 1 Gyr). To date, the outskirts of M dwarf planetary systems remain poorly understood, with only 5 resolved debris disk detections and sparse constraints on the presence of sub-Jovian planets. Early JWST results illustrated NIRCam's unique niche for studying these systems. However, prior and ongoing JWST imaging surveys have focused on targets in young moving groups, which have typical distances of 30 pc of more. At these distances, compact M dwarf planetary systems fall largely within the noisier speckle-dominated regime — inhibiting access to any faint circumstellar sources at Solar system scales. By targeting particularly nearby stars, our program will maximize sensitivity at the expected separations of M dwarf planetesimal belts (~25 au), providing access to sub-Jovian planets and debris disks exactly where we expect them to be. Moreover, with our discoveries likely falling at wide angular separations, they will be particularly amenable to follow-up with JWST spectroscopy — promising a rich legacy of value for our understanding of both M dwarf systems and planetary systems at large.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request dual-channel NIRCam coronagraphic observations using the F200W and F444W filters with the MASK335R coronagraph. We will observe each of our 22 M dwarf targets at only a single observatory roll and without dedicated reference stars — relying instead on self-referencing for PSF subtraction. We will use the same exposure settings for every target, chosen to maximize sensitivity at wide separations: SUB320 subarray, DEEP8 readout pattern, 18 groups/int, 8 ints/exposure. This results in a total science time of ~50 minutes per target and a total science time of 18.2 hours across the program (45.1 hours charged). Our observations are requested across 5 non-interruptible sequences of 3-6 targets each to ensure that each target has at least one near-contemporaneous observation of a close spectral type match for PSF subtraction. These sequences have been reordered to eliminate unnecessary slewing.
