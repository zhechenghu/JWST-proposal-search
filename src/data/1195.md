## ABSTRACT

TBD

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The NIRCam GTO team will execute a series of coronagraphic measurements using NIRCam. The goals of the program are two-fold. First, to search for previously unknown planets using NIRCam in the F356W and F444W filters with the round 430 mask being used for both filters. This version of the APT file uses F322W2 which we intend to change to F356W when this becomes available in a planned APT update. This program will achieve a sensitivity to masses less than 1 MJup at F444W and will use F356W to reject background stars and galaxies.
The second goal of the program is the physical characterization of the known planets HD95086 b using NIRCam multi-filter photometry. Three medium-band NIRCam filters will be used in conjunction with the long wavelength bar. The NIRCam observations will use two roll angles (+/-5 deg) and a reference star to assist with suppression of residuals in the coronagraphic image.
Comments:
- F322W2 filter instead of F356W
