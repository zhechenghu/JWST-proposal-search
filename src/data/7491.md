## ABSTRACT

AGNs in the epoch of reionization (EoR) provide critical constraints on the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Recent JWST observations revealed the prevalence of low-luminosity AGNs in the EoR, signaled by broad H-alpha line in a surprisingly large number of galaxies. Such broad H-alpha galaxies (BHaGs) are 10 - 100 times more numerous than inferred from the extrapolation of the classical quasar luminosity function (QLF). This may imply the presence of numerous quasars missing in the existing surveys at their faint end (-22 < Muv < -24). Alternatively, BHaGs may represent a new AGN population, forming an additional hump on the QLF. Discriminating between these scenarios has a huge impact on our understanding of SMBHs growing in the EoR, as well as the evoltion of their host galaxies and sources of reionization. Here we propose an ambitious NIRSpec program to search for broad H-alpha in UV-luminous galaxies, in the gap between the classical quasars and BHaGs. Such galaxies are too sparse on the sky to fall in randomly chosen JWST fields, but hold the key to finding the missing link between the two AGN populations. Our targets, 30 galaxies at 5.7 < z < 6.7, are drawn from the largest sample of spectroscopically-confirmed luminous galaxies in the EoR, established by the Subaru HSC survey. We will test the above scenarios with the number of detected AGNs, and will answer the following pressing questions on the SMBH populations in the EoR: (i) Do luminous galaxies host missing AGNs?; (ii) What is the true shape of the QLF?; (iii) Do broad H-alpha really signal the presence of AGN?; (iv) Will we find the first cases of "undermassive" SMBHs?

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program aims to take the rest-optical spectra of the most luminous galaxies in the EoR, in order to detect a broad wing component of H-alpha emission line. The targets are 30 galaxies at 5.7 <z< 6.7, originally selected by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. All the targets have been spectroscopically confirmed, with the rest-UV spectra taken by ground-based telescopes (Subaru and GTC). We will use NIRSpec with the G395H grating, whose spectral coverage will contain H-alpha redshifted to 4.4 â€” 5.1 um. The spectral resolution of R ~ 2700 is sufficient to resolve the expected broad line component with >1000 km/s, as well as the narrow core component (on top of the broad wing component) with ~300 km/s. Our requirement is to detect a broad H-alpha component with the minimum flux of 5 x 10^(-18) erg/s/cm2, with 5sigma confidence (see Technical Justification). The Exposure Time Calculator predicts that an on-source time of 2100 sec (28 groups x 1 integration x 1 exposure x 5 dithers) per target meets this requirement. Here the broad H-alpha width is assumed to be 2000 km/s. Roughly 30% of the targets have spatially-extended stellar emission in the HSC images (typical seeing ~0"8), but the broad H-alpha can be assumed to originate from a nuclear point source close to SMBH. We will adopt S200A2 slit, 5-point dither pattern, and FULL subarray in order to exploit the NRSIRS2RAPID readout mode.
