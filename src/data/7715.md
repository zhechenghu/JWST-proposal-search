## ABSTRACT

We propose to observe a carefully selected sample of 26 Milky Way stars with the MIRI Medium-Resolution Spectrometer to measure the detailed characteristics of the 10 micron silicate extinction feature. Variations in the feature properties (such as its strength, width and peak wavelength) will reveal variations in the properties of interstellar silicate grains between different sightlines. Combining these measurements with existing elemental abundance measurements of Mg, Fe, Si and O for the same sample of sightlines, will provide unprecedented insights into the detailed chemical composition of silicate dust grains in the interstellar medium.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose to observe 26 Milky Way stars with the MIRI Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) to measure the 10 micron silicate extinction feature. With the resolution of the MRS we will be able to measure the detailed profile of the feature, and detect small shifts in its peak wavelength and variations in its width between different sightlines. To fully cover the silicate feature (and surrounding continuum extinction), we will observe with the MRS in all three wavelength ranges in all four channels. We request a total of 38 hours to obtain the required SNR to study the details of the silicate extinction feature.
