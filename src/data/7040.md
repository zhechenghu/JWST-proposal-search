## ABSTRACT

Dust grains are the seeds of star and planet formation and are direct tracers of the chemical enrichment of the Universe. Despite the importance of dust in tracing our own cosmic origins, the origins of dust are unclear. Although core-collapse supernovae (ccSNe) with their metal-rich ejecta are considered to be prolific dust factories, both observational and theoretical studies challenge this claim given the destructive nature of SN shocks and suggest they may even be net dust destroyers.

Emerging classes of IR-luminous "gap" transients, which occupy the luminosity gap between novae and supernovae, indicate substantial dust formation and occur at a significant fraction of the SN rate. Gap transients may therefore prove to be the missing source of explosive dust production that could supplement or dominate the dust budget of galaxies. However, their dust production has been largely unexplored due to observational limitations on measuring their warm dusty ejecta at mid-IR wavelengths. With the capabilities of JWST, we are now able to directly address the role of gap transients as potential dust factories.

We propose a JWST Cycle 4 Survey program with a target list of 45 gap transients to measure their dust production with four filters of the MIRI Imager. Given that gap transients are largely discovered in nearby galaxies, they are fairly evenly distributed over the sky and ideal for a Survey program. Our key science goal is to determine whether or not gap transients are significant sources of dust relative to core-collapse supernovae. Given the potential benefit of our proposed dataset to the community at large, we will make our data immediately available.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

In this Survey proposal, we request a sample of 45 gap transients (=15 from each of the three classes) that are distributed over a wide range of Right Ascension). The minimum number of targets required to achieve our science goal is 15 (~5 from each class).

In order to systematically probe the warm dust emission from gap transients, we request a uniform observing configuration for all targets: MIRI Imaging using the F560W, F1000W, F1500W, and F2100W filters with a 3.7 min total exposure time per filter. The total duration of the observation is 100 min, which fits in the recommendation for Survey programs described in the JWST User Documentation.

Our proposed MIRI Imaging observation adheres to the recommended configuration with 4-point dithers and the FASTR1 readout pattern. Assuming the minimum number of targets requested are observed, the overall duration of our survey program is 25 hours. We do not place any constraints on our observations in order to maximize the schedulability of our proposed program. All data taken will be made immediately available to the public.

Since Survey proposals do not require a complete list of targets at the time of submission, we submit a placeholder target with 45 targets requested. As described in the Science Justification, we will draw our final target list from the systematic sample of gap transients presented by Karambelkar et al. (2023) as well as newly reported gap transients on the Transient Name Server. In order to probe gap transient dust while it is warm, we restrict the age of the transients to the past ~5 years.
