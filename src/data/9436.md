## ABSTRACT

We propose a highly efficient Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) observation of the active mid-M dwarf K2-384, which hosts five transiting planets, including a potential water-world. On July 10–11, 2025, three of these planets—K2-384c, e, and f—will transit in a rare, non-overlapping configuration within a 13-hour window. This unique opportunity enables us to empirically isolate stellar contamination using the Transit Light Source Effect (TLSE) and jointly model stellar heterogeneity across all three transits. We will use NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy to constrain the atmospheric composition of K2-384f and place upper limits on planetsc ande. The proposed observation also provides a benchmark dataset for developing and publicly releasing a new retrieval module that models unified stellar heterogeneity across multiple transits. This program will directly inform future JWST strategies for characterizing planets around active stars like M dwarfs, maximizing scientific return in a single short visit.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose a time-critical NIRSpec/PRISM observation of the K2-384 system on July 10–11, 2025, when three of its five transiting planets—K2-384 c, e, and f—will undergo non-overlapping transits within a 13-hour window. This rare alignment provides a unique opportunity to disentangle stellar contamination using the Transit Light Source Effect (TLSE) and place atmospheric constraints on each planet—particularly the potential water-world K2-384 f—within a single, efficient visit.

This configuration does not recur in any of the next three JWST cycles, making this date the only viable opportunity to observe all three transits together. No alternative date will capture this geometry or enable the joint stellar heterogeneity modeling essential to our science goals.

We selected NIRSpec/PRISM for its broad wavelength coverage and sensitivity to molecular features like water, critical for both atmospheric retrieval and modeling of unocculted stellar regions. Observations will use the SUB512S subarray and NRSRAPID readout mode, optimized to prevent saturation while maximizing observing efficiency. We set 5 groups per integration over 49,000 integrations and will perform target acquisition using WATA with the F110W filter.

We will reduce the data using multiple pipelines—both the official JWST pipeline and custom routines developed by our team—to ensure robust results. Atmospheric retrievals will be conducted using SCARLET, petitRADTRANS, TauREx, and other tools to cross-validate findings and evaluate model sensitivity.

Importantly, this observation will support the development of a new retrieval module for modeling unified stellar contamination across multiple transits in a single dataset. The module will be made publicly available and will provide critical functionality for the broader community studying planets orbiting active stars.
