## ABSTRACT

Cold ice giant and gas giant exoplanets (<200K, 0.03 - 10 Mjup) in systems orbiting low-mass stars (0.08 - 0.45 Msun) could prove to be one of the most common types of exoplanets in the galaxy, yet we currently know of none that we can characterize through direct measurements. This survey presents an efficient pathway to utilize JWST's unique capabilities to accomplish a major objective in the exoplanet observing community: directly imaging a benchmark set of sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets. We propose a survey that has excellent coverage for detecting the under-studied population of ice-giant exoplanets (0.05 Mjup), which is out of reach for all but the most tailored JWST direct imaging observations. We will observe six of the nearest (< 6 pc), young (< 1 Gyr) M-dwarfs to directly image exoplanets down to temperatures of 75K and as small as Neptune. We select nearby targets to optimize our coverage to the orbits where we expect giant planets to be the most prevalent (1 - 15 AU). We propose to use F444W NIRCam Coronagraphic Imaging in conjunction with F2100W MIRI Imaging to ensure the detection of clear and cloudy exoplanets. Based on our survey sensitivity and previously measured occurrence rates of giant planets, we predict a discovery yield of 4.6 (+2.9 -1.9) planets, and nondetections would challenge the existing occurrence rates to 2.5-sigma. Exoplanets identified through this survey will be ideal candidates for JWST spectroscopic follow-up characterization to further understand the formation differences between gas giant and ice giant exoplanets and enable comparative planetology to the giant planets in our own solar system.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will use F444W+MASK335R NIRCam Coronagraphic Imaging and F2100W MIRI Imaging to complete a direct imaging survey of 6 M-dwarfs: Wolf 359, Ross 154, DX Cancri, AD Leo, EV Lac, and YZ CMi. By electing to use both NIRCam and MIRI, we will be sensitive to cold sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets with cloudy and clear atmospheres.
NIRCam: We will integrate on each target for a total of 51 min in F444W with MASK335R. We elect to use F200W as our short filter. We will use MEDIUM8 readout with 8 groups and 4 exposures with a 9-point small grid dither. We will use self-reference PSFs to increase observing efficiency and perform PSF subtraction using reference differential imaging.
MIRI: We will image each target for 50 min in the F2100W. We elect a 2-point dither pattern and FASTR1 readout with the SUB256 subarray. We will perform PSF subtraction using RDI KLIP post-processing.
