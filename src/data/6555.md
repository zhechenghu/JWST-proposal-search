## ABSTRACT

We propose to obtain multi-color NIRCam and MIRI image of a massive star forming region to highlight the stars, dust, and gas to reveal its physical conditions in a nearby galaxy.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal will use NIRCam and MIRI imaging to obtain broad and narrow-band imaging of a star forming region to be released in 2024. The images must be sufficiently deep to allow for the creation of low-noise color-composite images. The dither patterns are optimized for uniform depth, efficient removal of cosmic rays and other artifacts. These criteria will also produce very high-quality, science-ready data products for use by the community. This proposal does not include spectroscopic observations.
