## ABSTRACT

Asteroids act as dynamical and chemical tracers of the formation and evolution of our Solar System. The history of water in the Solar System is fundamental, both cosmochemically and astrobiologically, and observing water on asteroids helps constrain the story of our planetary system and of life on Earth. However, until now, this has been a very challenging endeavor. The most prominent hydration feature present on asteroids is found near 3 microns. This wavelength region is difficult to observe from Earth because water in the Earth's atmosphere makes that spectral region nearly opaque. We propose here to carry out a pure parallel survey to measure the fraction of main belt asteroids that are water-bearing. We will observe around 100 asteroids with sizes as small as 100 meters. We will measure the fraction of asteroids with hydration features larger than around 10%, and derive the amount of water present in the asteroid belt. A pure parallel project with JWST is the only way to carry out this experiment, with its implications for the formation and evolution of our Solar System and life on Earth. Our expected sensitivity is well matched to LSST, so all objects that we observe will, in a few years, also have known orbits, colors, taxa, and lightcurves.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will carry out a NIRCam pure parallel survey to measure the fraction of main belt asteroids that are water-bearing. Each of our visits requires about 1367 seconds and includes two consecutive observations (F150W+F277W; F200W+F277W). The vast majority of available primary orbits have visit times that far exceed our visit request; acceptable primary pointings will have ecliptic latitudes less than around 10 degrees. In total we request 100 visits, to 100 unique pointings, for a total time request of around 38 hours.
