## ABSTRACT
    We propose to exploit the synergy of NIRCam and NIRSpec to characterize, for the first time, the initial mass function (IMF) down to 15 Jupiter masses in NGC 602, a low-metallicity (1/5 Solar) young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). NGC 602 formed in an isolated location in the "wing” of the SMC, still it hosts numerous OB stars. It is the only low-metallicity young (about 2 Myr) star cluster where, with JWST, planetary-mass Brown Dwarfs have been detected, thus offering an opportunity to study the impact of stellar feedback from OB stars across the cluster region. We will collect tens of NIRSpec spectra of young, low-metallicity Brown Dwarfs. By targeting a completely unexplored parameter space (young and low metallicity), we will assemble a unique dataset that will have long-lasting legacy value for all the studies of Brown Dwarf formation, especially at sub-Solar metallicity. Only combining deep NIRCam photometry and NIRSpec MOS it is possible to derive accurate spectral-type-based masses and measure ages better than 0.5 Myr using evolutionary models and spectral templates. This dataset will add an invaluable piece to the puzzle of the formation of sub stellar objects at conditions that are different than Solar, and will address the environmental condition impact on the young star cluster IMF.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
    The goals of this proposal are deep NIRCam photometry and NIRSpec MOS to measure the sub-stellar initial mass function (IMF) down to 15 Jupiter masses and obtain the first spectra of around 45 young Brown Dwarfs (BDs) outside the Milky Way.

    NIRCam photometry:
    To fulfill our science goals of characterizing the sub-stellar IMF down to 15 Jupiter masses we request NIRCam photometry in 6 different filters: F140M, F162M, F182M, F277W, F360M, F444W. This combination of medium and wide-band filters is necessary to separate BDs from main sequence stars using CMDs and two-color diagrams by targeting H2O absorption bands (F140M, F182M) + continuum (F162M) and CH4 (F360M), which are much deeper in BDs compared to low-mass stars. Two continuum filters (F277W, F444W) will show infrared excess in PMS stars and reveal the very different SED shape of background galaxies. To reach a S/N >10 in all filters a total integration time per filter of 41,744s is needed. To optimally cover the cluster region and simultaneously observe a background field West of NGC 602 possible due to the large field of view of NIRCam, we will use the FULLBOX 6 dither pattern. Additionally, we apply 9 subpixel dithers allowing us to optimally sample the PSF, which is particularly important at short wavelengths, where the NIRCam detector is under sampled. We chose the readout pattern MEDIUM2 with 8 groups and 1 integration each, which is a good compromise between data volume, to avoid data excess warnings allowing maximum flexibility for scheduling, and dynamic range. We will utilize readout groups 0 and 1 as well as the archival data of program GO-2662 to recover most of the bright, saturated point sources.

    NIRSpec MOS:
    To obtain around 45 BD spectra and 30 low-mass PMS spectra in PRISM mode 3 individual MOS configurations are required. With a total exposure time of 27,835s per configuration a continuum S/N>15 can be reached for all objects above 50 Jupiter masses. We use the NRSIRS2 readout pattern, which suppresses the 1/f noise thus improving the S/N. We apply 3-point nods to subtract the local background. Each observation requires 6 integrations with 21 groups each leaving the exposure time per integration at ~1550s, which is sufficiently short to avoid severe impacts from comsic rays, as recommened by the NIRSpec team. The many isolated point sources in the region are sufficient for MSATA.
