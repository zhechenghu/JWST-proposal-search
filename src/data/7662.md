## ABSTRACT

Planet-forming disks show a striking dichotomy in their chemical makeup: disks around low-mass stars often exhibit a higher carbon-to-oxygen ratio, while those around solar-mass stars display more oxygen-rich chemistry. These differences are believed to result from the sublimation and freeze-out of volatile species like CO, CO2, and H2O, but the precise origin of this carbon dichotomy remains uncertain. We hypothesize that the composition dichotomy in disks arises from the irreversible sublimation of carbon-bearing grains, and that the accretion rate, rather than stellar mass, plays a key role in driving carbon enrichment. Initial analyses of MIRI data published in the literature show a clear trend of higher C2H2 (relative to H2O) columns with decreasing accretion rate, supporting our hypothesis, though much remains unexplored. To provide a stringent test, we propose to conduct a survey of 14 protoplanetary disks using MIRI-MRS, targeting systems across ranges of unexplored accretion rates and stellar masses, complemented by archival data from 8 low accretion sources. By measuring the relative amount of hydrocarbons like C2H2 and oxygen-rich species like H2O, we will determine whether low accretion rates indeed promote carbon-rich chemistries. To complement the observational analysis, we will perform a combination of thermochemical and dynamical modeling to investigate how accretion, pebble drift, and sublimation processes influence the molecular content of disks. This will offer new insights into how these factors shape disk chemistry, with direct implications for JWST observations of disks, and help us understand the composition of planets forming in these systems.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The goal of this program is to observe MIRI-MRS spectra of 14 sources covering the full spectral range (4.9-28 micron) by using all three grating settings of the four MRS channels. Our sensitivities are adjusted to obtain a S/N~150 between 10-16 microns, where most of the molecular features of interest (C2H2, CO2, HCN, C6H6, C4H2) are located. To minimize fringing, we also include target acquisition using the FND filter. Since the primary emission from these sources originates in the inner few au, and they are located at distances of 130-190 au, these sources will be unresolved point sources, therefore, we will use a 4-point dither pattern in the negative direction to increase the spatial and spectral sampling. The fast readout pattern is used for 9 of the sources where we expect fluxes higher than 15mJy at 12 micron (based on WISE W3 measurements). In the other 5 sources, we used the slow readout pattern to avoid exceeding the data volume limit.
