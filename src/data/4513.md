## ABSTRACT

We will observe four fields in the nearest classical Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies Draco and Sculptor, to study the internal proper motion dynamics of their stars. This will determine whether their dark halos have central cores or cusps, which provides an important constraint on the properties of dark matter and cosmological models of galaxy formation. Proper motions will be determined both from comparison to existing HST data and from comparison to JWST observations obtained in GTO Cycle 1.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose to measure the internal proper motion dynamics of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Draco and Sulptor. To determine proper motion of stars in our target galaxies, we will observe four fields (two in the Draco, and two in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidals) with NIRCAM using F200W+F277W. We will also observe parallel fields with NIRISS using F200W.
