## ABSTRACT

The goal of the observations is to map (redshifted) optical nebular lines in the host galaxy and circumgalactic region of a luminous quasars at z~6 (SDSS J0100+2802). The observations (obtained with the high resolution grating) will also be used to detect and characterize the quasar-driven outflows.
Submission April 2022:
- coordinates updated after the discovery of NED' s bug (Dec: +28 02 55.80 (old) --> +28 02 25.80 (new))
- PA constraint slightly modified as a consequence of the coordinates change

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Contact: Roberto Maiolino (r.maiolino@mrao.cam.ac.uk)

The NIRSpec IFU observations are done with the G395H grating and are aimed aimed primarily at mapping the strongest optical nebular lines (Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha, [NII]) in order to trace the distribution and kinematics of the medium in the host galaxy and the circumgalactic region.

We are not using TA as Gaia GS are available for any orientation, hence ensuring a pointing accuracy adequate for our goals.

PA has been restricted to minimise MSA leakage effects
