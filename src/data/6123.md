## ABSTRACT
    The recent discovery of UHZ-1, a candidate X-ray bright AGN at z=10.1, has been hailed as the smoking gun for the direct collapse black hole model. UHZ1 is thought to host a highly obscured, accreting black hole whose mass is between 5 and 100% that of its host galaxy. This program aims to acquire deep mid-IR imaging of UHZ1 (rest-frame 0.4-2.2 micron), with the goal (1) to confirm (or disprove) the presence of an AGN; (2) if the AGN is confirmed, provide an independent lower limit (or estimate) to the black hole mass, so as to test the viability of the direct collapse scenario.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
    MIRI imaging in 9 bands, achieving signal to noise ratios between 10-20.
