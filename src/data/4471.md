## ABSTRACT

A re-measurement of the NIRISS distortion and offset from the Guider is requested for trending of any possible changes in the astrometric distortion with time. A single epoch observation will be made in all the NIRISS imaging filters using the same pointing in the Large Magelanic Cloud astrometric field as was used for this purpose in commissioning and in cycle 1 calibration.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The program carries out an astrometric calibration of NIRISS using the same method as what is to be done during commissioning. It is a continuation of cycle 1 program 1501.
There are two duplicate sets of observations with a minimum gap of about 150 days between the first set and the second set to produce two measurements well separated in cycle 1. The first set is scheduled sometime in the first three months of cycle 2 assuming a start date of 1 July 2023.
The program here is based on CAR 1087, the initial NIRISS astrometric calibration.
