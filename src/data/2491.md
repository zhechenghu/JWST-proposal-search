## ABSTRACT

Despite the need for very high gas densities to overcome the tidal field of the supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) and induce gravitational collapse, there is increasing evidence for star formation taking place at the heart of the Milky Way. With the superb capabilities of the JWST MIRI MRS integral field spectrograph, we will finally be able to test the hypothesis of low-mass star formation at the Galactic Centre (GC). We propose to observe a group of faint mid-infrared sources in the nuclear star cluster to uncover their true nature. Their extreme infrared excess and spectral indices (based on long integration VLT L- and N-band data) and their association with photoevaporative protoplanetary disk-like counterparts in the radio, make them prime candidates for embedded low-mass young stars, located just about 0.5 pc in projection away from Sgr A*. Only MIRI MRS will be able to study and even characterise these sources in such unprecedented detail that was only possible so far for nearby star forming regions. Confirming the presence of low-mass young stars at the GC has implications on disk dispersion time-scales in dense clusters, which opens up the potential for planet formation in the tidally stressed environment of galactic nuclei.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal aims at using MIRI MRS to observe a group of protoplanetray disk candidates, located just half a parsec to the East from the central SMBH at the GC. The obtained MRS spectra will confirm their nature, and allow for a thorough characterisation of their properties.

The group of sources we intend to observe are arranged in two spatial groups, RC1 and RC2. Group RC1 will be observed in a 3x2 mosaic (with 10% overlap) to ensure that all sources are covered by the smaller FOV of channel 1. The second group RC2 will be observed in a 1x2 mosaic. This is sufficient to cover all sources of RC2 considering it is smaller that RC1.

We propose to use the full wavelength coverage of the MIRI MRS channel 1 to channel 4 with a 4-point dither pattern and FAST readout mode. We will not use the simultaneous imaging due to saturation risk from the bright members of the nuclear cluster. We have also included a background pointing on a region far from the cluster to be able to measure the telescope's thermal emission. The background observations use the same detector configuration and a 2-point dither pattern and are linked in a non-interruptible sequence so that they are obtained immediately before and after one another.

We request a total telescope time of 11.61 hours (5.66 hours science time + overheads) to obtain reasonable SNRs in most channels for the faint compact sources (~5-15 mJy measured at 8.6 micron). The estimated exposure times were done in the ETC using multiple scenes and sources, corresponding to point and extended sources found in the FOV and a MIR spectrum of the Galactic Centre from ISO-SWS.

At the edge of the targeted FOV, there are a couple of MIR bright sources (part of the IRS 5 complex) that may cause partial saturation at the edges of the channel 4 detector, away from the science targets.

No target acquisition is required as the FOV and the targeted sources have known precise positions from radio observations.
