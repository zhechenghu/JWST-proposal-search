## ABSTRACT

JWST offers the very first opportunity to spectroscopically characterize the surfaces of rocky exoplanets. Observations in previous cycles have constrained their surface albedos, but this is degenerate with a wide range of surface properties. Here we propose to observe the most promising surface characterization target known, LHS 3844 b, to robustly (greater than 3 sigma) detect surface spectral features from an exoplanet for the first time. This will allow us to leverage the vast expertise developed for Solar System rocky bodies to establish a new field of 'exo-geology' whose goal is to explore the geological histories and mantle compositions of rocky exoplanets.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Our observations consist of 8 MIRI LRS (slitless) eclipses and 1 NIRSpec G395H eclipse for our target, LHS 3844 b. We propose to use the same instrument settings as the previous programs (GO 1846 and 4008) on this target that maximize efficiency and avoid saturation. For the MIRI observations, we can use LHS 3844 as the TA star. For the NIRSpec observations, LHS 3844 is too bright for target acquisition, so we elect to use the same TA star as the previous GO program.
