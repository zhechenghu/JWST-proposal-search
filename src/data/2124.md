## ABSTRACT

Using cold brown dwarfs to understand Jupiter-like atmospheres hinges on defining and explaining their diverse properties. In this JWST proposal we have used the parallax sample of the reddest/faintest brown dwarfs to define a sample of 12 sources that share a common mid infrared color -- our proxy for temperature -- but show meaningfully different 4.5 micron absolute magnitudes. Guided by what we have found for warmer brown dwarfs, we will use JWST data on this sample to map the diversity of cold brown dwarfs in (A) cloud properties (B) metallicity (C) gravity (D) binarity (E) overall chemistry or a combination of two or more of these properties. Understanding how each of those parameters alters the observable properties of a brown dwarf or giant exoplanet is crucial to interpreting cold worlds beyond our own. Using JWST spectra and photometry, we will compute bolometric luminosities for all 12 objects in our sample and use those values to anchor our mid infrared color binning. We will then compare and contrast spectral features at the peak of the spectral energy distribution that can be attributed to any of the known secondary impacts listed above. In doing so, this proposal will create a JWST legacy observational road map for both low-mass brown dwarfs and cold giant exoplanets to interpret the complex data emerging from extrasolar Jupiter-like objects.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal is to obtain NIRSPEC G395H spectra and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W imaging for 12 brown dwarfs. The sources vary in Spitzer ch2 brightness from 12.3 mag to 15.5 mag. For the NIRSPEC spectra we use the S200A1 slit and we use three dithers along the slit for the observations. Acquisition images are all WATA using the SUB2048 subarray and the clear filter. For MIRI observing we use the full subarray in all cases. Each source has a large proper motion and parallax which are known and entered. We found no special requirements for the observations.
