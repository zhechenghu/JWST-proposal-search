## ABSTRACT

**ABSTRACT**
This NIRSpec/JWST proposal, is divided into two complementary programs. In the first program, we propose to obtain low and medium resolution near-IR spectra of known and candidate brown dwarfs in two nearby star-forming clusters that are representative of different star formation environments.
NIRSpec proposal ID: R65.10

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

**OBSERVING DESCRIPTION**
We will acquire low and medium resolution MOS/NIRSpec observations in the ONC, including parallel observations.
The observations can be acquired in any of the two possible visibility windows in the Cycle, but preferencially we would like them to be taken in the earliest window in the Cycle.
