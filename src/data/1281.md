## ABSTRACT

We will characterize the atmosphere of the Saturn-mass exoplanet HAT-P-12 b (molecular content, hazes, pressure - temperature profile) by observing spectroscopically the star light transmitted through the atmosphere during a transit of the exoplanet in front of its host star.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This is time series observations. The observations are time constrained; the observations have to start phased for transit of the exoplanet. We plan to observe with the MIRI slitless LRS mode one transit of HAT-P-12b in front of its host star. Due to detector saturation, we can't use the NIRSPEC prism mode to have the full wavelength coverage in one transit or one eclipse. Then we will devote two transits observations to get a medium resolution transmission spectrum over the 1.66 - 5.27 microns wavelength range. No parallel observations for these observations which require very high stability.
