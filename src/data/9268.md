## ABSTRACT

This program aims to determine the pathlosses accurately in the 0.6-1.5 micron range where the spectra obtained in previous calibration programs were saturated, and therefore an accurate pathloss correction could not be derived in those wavelength ranges. These data will allow us to derive a precise pathloss correction in this wavelength range. This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We are observing a white dwarf that does not saturate in the 0.6-1.5 micron end before the two groups of integration. We will observe the target in the S200A1 and S200A2 slits using the 9 and 15 dither positions to determine the pathlosses in the 0.6-1.5 micron wavelength range, in these patterns that are the most affected by pathlosses.
