## ABSTRACT

Observations of a compact planetary nebula in the southern continuous viewing zone will be used to derive the grism wavelength solutions for the GR150R and GR150C grisms in the six blocking filters. A 3x3 mosaic of pointings is used to move the nebula around within the NIRISS field of view.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Observations of the compact planetry nebula SMP LMC 58 will be used to determine the wavelength solutions for the NIRISS WFSS grisms GR150C and GR150R. The nebula will be dithered over the detector to determine whether there is any position dependence to the dispersion.
