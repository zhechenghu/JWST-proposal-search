## ABSTRACT

In order to characterize the point spread function (PSF) as a function of wavelength in the LRS slit and slitless modes, we will scan a point source across the two nod positions and the center of the slit and across the nominal pointing position in the SLITLESSPRISM subarray. These observations will improve the signal/noise ratio (SNR) obtained during commissioning in CAR-MIRI-074 and in Cycle 1 (CAL-MIRI-034). Detailed knowledge of the LRS PSF and the availability of a super-resolution PSF model will test the WebbPSF model, improve the SNR of the outer PSF, and facilitate better algorithms for extracting spectra from two-dimensional spectral images.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program observes standard stars in the slit and in slitless mode with a sub-pixel scan to sample the point-spread function.
Observations 1-4 are a non-interruptible sequence.
Observations 5-6 are also a non-interruptible sequence.

TIMING CONSTRAINTS:
None.

BACKUP TARGET:
HD 180609 is a backup target if BD+60 1753 is not available and can be observed with the same intergration times.
