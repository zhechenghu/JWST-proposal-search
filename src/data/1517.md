## ABSTRACT

CAL-MIRI-001
This activity will obtain calibration data for all three MIRI detectors early in Cycle 1 to address three issues that will set the ultimate sensitivity limit for MIRI: read noise, dark current, and the reset anomaly, including the non-ideal behavior of individual integration ramps caused by the reset. All three effects require reference files for each detector in the JWST calibration pipeline. The data will also be used to flag hot, dead, and high-noise pixels for the bad-pixel mask. The activity will produce a full suite of data including simultaneous data from the full imager detector and the two MRS detectors with the contamination control cover (CCC) closed and data in all of the available subarrays except SLITLESSPRISM with the CCC open.

This APT file includes the CCC-open darks from CAL-MIRI-001 as well as those from CAL-MIRI-003 (reset switch charge decay calibration). The observations from CAL-MIRI-001 with the CCC closed are now in the APT file for PID 1519.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

CAL-MIRI-001 MIRI Read Noise and Dark Current Monitoring
CAL-MIRI-003 MIRI Reset Switch Charge Decay

The Initial suite of darks for CAL-MIRI-001 with the CCC closed can be found in the APT file for PID 1519.
This APT file includes the darks obtained with the CCC open for both CAL-MIRI-001 and CAL-MIRI-003

For all observations:
The CCC should be open
The filter wheel should be set to OPAQUE
They should be obtained as parallels
Individual observations can be executed separately

Group 1 - CAL-MIRI-001 - Initial darks - Obs 1-174
Group 2 - CAL-MIRI-003 - RSCD darks - Obs 175-179
Group 3 - CAL-MIRI-001 - Dark monitor - Obs 180-184
