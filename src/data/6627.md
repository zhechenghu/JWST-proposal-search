## ABSTRACT

This activity monitors NIRCam's distortion and global alignment by visiting the LMC Calibration Field in both imaging and coronagraph imaging. The data will be used to determine the plate scale, orientation, and geometric distortion for each SCA in each NIRCam module over the full wavelength range. These observations use a combination of dithers and mosaics to overlap all SCAs onto the same location within the LMC.
We use F210M and F335M with FGS in parallel for the overall FGS SIAF alignment.
We observe all NIRCam filters with either MIRI or NIRCam in parallel, which will provide intra-instrument relative alignment.
We use a 2x2 mosaic with a large overlap and no dithers in order to observe the different filters with a minimal change of guiding for each position.
For coronagraphy we chose one of the brightest star of our previous LMC field (K mag ~10, always saturated) and the aim of Obs 5 is to observe it useing the coronagraphic template to check precisely its landing position behing the MASK335R occulter (using all other stars) against the techniques used with a single star (cross correlation with small grid dithers and a grid of PSF models).
Obs 6 is using NB filters and CLEAR pupil to acquite that star unsaturated and make sure its position is well know with respect to the other stars. For that we used the 640 subarray.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

**EXPOSURE SETUP:** We use readout patterns and groups/integrations appropriate for a broad dynamic range of LMC stars, as demonstrated by Commissioning and Cycle 1&2 observations of the LMC Calibration field.

**DITHERS:** We include 2x2 mosaic for imaging and 9 INTRASCA 24" dithers for coronagraphy.
**MOSAIC:** We include mosaics that place each SCA at the same location in the LMC.
FGS is in parallel for all observations 1 & 2. MIRI and NIRISS are in parallel for observations 3 and 4, respectively.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.
