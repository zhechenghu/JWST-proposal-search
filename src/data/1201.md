## ABSTRACT

We will use NIRISS SOSS to acquire transit and eclipse observations of a sample of 14 exoplanets that span the full available range of equilibrium temperatures (300-3000 K) and masses (1 MEarth-10 MJup) for planets amenable to atmospheric characterization. Our observations will measure the abundance of the molecules and aerosols present in the exoplanets' atmosphere and determine the vertical temperature structure of the hottest targets. These results will allow us to address fundamental issues such as the formation process and formation location of these close-in planets, the presence and characteristics of particulate clouds, and non-equilibrium chemistry effects that might be at play in their atmosphere. Six of our targets are rocky and for these we intend to place some of the first constraints on the mean molecular weight – and hence bulk composition – of their atmospheres. In particular, we will observe multiple transits of the potentially habitable earth-like planets TRAPPIST-1 d & f, aiming to make the first detection of the atmosphere of a habitable planet. Finally, for two targets, WASP-121b and LTT 9779b, we will acquire observations continuously throughout a full orbital period to constrain their temperature-pressure profile as a function of longitude and study how heat is absorbed and redistributed in their atmosphere.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Our targets, numbers of visits, and the types of events observed are given below. Unless otherwise noted, the observations are done with NIRISS SOSS.

LTT 9779b (full phase curve including 2 eclipses)

HAT-P-1b (one transit, one eclipse)
WASP-52b (one transit)
WASP-127b (one transit)

WASP-80b (one eclipse)
WASP-107b (one transit with SOSS, one eclipse with NIRSpec F290LP/G395H)
GJ-3470b (one eclipse with NIRSPEC)

TRAPPIST-1d (2 transits with NIRSpec prism)
TRAPPIST-1f (5 transits)
GJ 357b (one transit)
L98-59c (one transit)
L98-59d (one transit)
LP 791-18c (one transit with NIRSPEC prism)

Being slitless, the NIRISS SOSS mode is subject to contamination from overlapping spectra of other stars in the NIRISS field of view. The level and detail of such contamination vary with the aperture position angle (APA) of the observation, and it is thus important to execute our observation at an appropriate APA to eliminate this contamination. For all of our observations we have used our contamination prediction tool to determine the range of allowed APA that would ensure that there would be no significant contamination of our target spectrum.

All of our observations are tied to exoplanet transit events and thus have timing constraints in the form of a phase constraint (or "between dates" for TRAPPIST-1 planets). We have allowed a timing window of >60 min to schedule the start of each observation.

The target TRAPPIST-1 is the only exception departing from the phase constraint, as dynamical interaction between its multiple planets lead to non-periodic timing of the transit events, such that a phase constraint is inappropriate. For this target, we have thus used "between dates" timing constraints based on the actual transit times predicted from the full multi-planet dynamical model. In addition, SOSS observations of TRAPPIST-1 are significantly affected by contamination from field stars at all available PA's during its late Nov – early Jan visibility window, and thus TRAPPIST-1 can be observed with SOSS only during its June – July visibility window.
