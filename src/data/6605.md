## ABSTRACT

This program obtains observations of hot stars as part of the JWST absolute flux calibration effort. This effort uses all JWST instruments to provide absolute flux calibration for all JWST modes (filters, gratings, etc). The combined nature of this effort is to ensure the highest quality flux calibration internal to and between instruments and to carry out the observations efficiently. This program provides observations of hot stars and companion programs provide observations of A dwarfs and solar analog observations. The absolute flux observations will be compared to model predictions of the stars' flux densities to calculate the appropriate calibration factors per instrument mode.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Observations of hot stars for absolute flux calibration. Includes observation for part 1 and 2 of the combined instrument program. Part 1 observes one star in each instrument mode/detector where this star was observed in cycle 1 and shown to be a high quality absflux star. Part 2 observes a large sample in a subset of the modes to define the average, vet the sample, and diagnose any instrumental dependancies of the flux calibration (e.g. flux).
