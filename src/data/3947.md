## ABSTRACT

High-resolution imaging of protoplanetary disks at near-infrared and mm wavelengths has shown that disk substructure is ubiquitous, but the connection to ongoing planet formation remains unclear and actively debated. Spiral features in particular offer unique clues about disk physics and the dynamical interaction between planets and disks. The two leading hypotheses for the origin of spiral structure are gravitational instabilities and dynamical interactions with a giant planet orbiting immediately outside of the disk. We propose to test whether spiral arm structure in protoplanetary disks predominantly originates from long-period giant planets on external orbits using deep JWST/NIRCam coronagraphic imaging. The goals of this program are to (1) establish whether giant planets on external orbits are the primary drivers of spiral arm structure, and (2) identify new giant planets amenable to follow-up atmospheric characterization. This program will take advantage of JWST's extraordinary sensitivity at thermal wavelengths to consistently reach sub-Jovian masses beyond the outer disk radius of each system, regardless of assumptions about the planetary cooling history (hot, warm, or cold initial conditions). Deep observations of this “dynamically informed” sample of protoplanetary disks with spiral-driven arms may represent one of the best opportunities to discover planets with JWST early in its primary mission.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The goal of this NIRCam high-contrast imaging program is to search for Jovian-mass planets (1-15 Mjup) orbiting outside of five protoplanetary disks that show spiral-driven arms in dust emission or scattered light: AB Aur, Elias 2-27, IM Lup, Wa Oph 6, and RU Lup. The F444W filter is used to optimize sensitivity to low-temperature (~500-700 K) planets to fully explore the entire giant planet mass range, even in the case of cold start thermal evolution. Following guidelines for NIRCam coronagraphic imaging, each observing sequence with the MASK335R circular mask consists of deep imaging of the science target at two roll angles, followed by a small dither pattern of a nearby PSF reference star with a similar spectral type as the science target. These three observations for each system are scheduled as a non-interruptible sequences to avoid wavefront drifts and thermal changes, which can influence the PSF shape and PSF subtraction performance.
