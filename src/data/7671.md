## ABSTRACT

This program obtains repeated observations of two stars as part of the JWST absolute flux calibration effort. This effort uses all JWST instruments to provide absolute flux calibration for all JWST modes (filters, gratings, etc). The combined nature of this effort is to ensure the highest quality flux calibration internal to and between instruments and to carry out the observations efficiently. This program provides observations of two stars spread throughout the year to measure the repeatability of JWST observations. The aim is to observe in one filter/grating/etc per detector to measure how repeatable an observation is in instrument units. The expectation is that the repeatability is set at the detector level.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The objective of this program is to observe the same star with identical observing parameters with a regular cadence throughout Cycle 4 to monitor the repeatability of detectors, instrument modes, and the telescope.
The cadence should be one epoch every 8 weeks, with the exception of the brief period of invisibility for each target.
Observations are grouped by target, with 2 series of 6 epochs each.
