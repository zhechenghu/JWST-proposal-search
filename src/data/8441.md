## ABSTRACT

While the future of comparative planetology lies in obtaining direct spectroscopic measurements of distant giant planets, they remain an observational challenge even for JWST. That said, JWST has recently been used to directly detect a temperate 250K - 275K gas giant world orbiting the solar type star Epsilon Ind A and there are four other cycle 2 or 3 programs (4982, 5229, 3337, 5037) targeting temperate worlds but the results are pending. While the detection of Epsilon Ind Ab demands a celebration of JWST's capabilities, it was challenging, high risk and -- at this point -- only a photometric detection. The programs in waiting will hopefully add to the cold, directly imaged world collection however, interpreting planets' photometric and low-resolution data will rely heavily on atmospheric model predictions in a largely untested regime. Luckily, cold brown dwarfs (500K > Teff > 250K) are isolated and bright enough that they make ideal spectral targets that can be studied as a population with the precision of JWST TODAY. With this program we will obtain G395H and/or MIRI MRS spectra for 14 cold brown dwarfs, combine those with publically available archival data for an additional two sources so we generate a complete "cold world spectral library". Leveraging the spectral precision attainable for isolated cold brown dwarfs with JWST, we will establish the gold standard of atmospheric properties by probing pressure-dependent abundances, key tracers of clouds, disequilibrium chemistry, vertical mixing, auroral processes, and formation pathways. Our legacy library will enable comparative planetology across the Solar System, exoplanets, and brown dwarfs.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will create a cold world spectral library out of a combination of new and/or publically available archival JWST data on 16 targets. Four targets will receive NIRSpec G395H and MIRI MRS data, 12 objects have archival G395H data but will receieve MIRI MRS data, and two sources have archival G395H and MIRI MRS data therefore they will round out the sample with the proposed set-up.

NIRSpec G395H data will be acquired using the default WATA mode with the CLEAR filter for NIRSpec and the F1000W filter for MIRI spectroscopy. Sources will be dithered along the slit using a 3-point pattern for NIRSpec and a 4-point pattern for MIRI MRS. We use the NRSRAPID readout for NIRSPec and SLOWR1 readout for MIRI.
