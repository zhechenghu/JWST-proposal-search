## ABSTRACT

The objective of this program is to obtain CCC-Closed darks in order to update the Dark Current reference files for FULL frame Imager and the MRS detectors in SLOWR1 and FASTR1, and to exercise the CCC.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Cycle 2 showed that we can obtain higher-quality Imager darks by allowing the persistence from idle to decay prior to the first dark exposure. As we await data from CAL-MIRI-301 to determine the best method for subtracting the dark current, we choose to obtain 5 exposures in SLOWR1 and FASTR1 for the Full frame in all 3 detectors. We exclude subarrays to optimize absolute calibration of the FULL frame in the interim.
As in CAL-MIRI-200, we schedule the FASTR1 Imager darks after allowing the persistence to decay, however in this case we opt to put the SLOWR1 darks with all detectors first as the MRS detectors are less affected by the persistence, and the readout mode is used overall less often for the Imager.
We plan the observations with no timing constraints as these must be obtained as prime, which is to our benefit as we wish to exercise the CCC more often.
We will obtain CCC-Closed Darks with all three detectors with the same exposure parameters as in previous cycles. We opt for 5 pairs of observations with the SLOWR1 darks for all detectors first, followed by FASTR1.
