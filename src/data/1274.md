## ABSTRACT

We will observe secondary eclipses of four hot Jupiters using NIRCam to meaasure their thermal emission spectra.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Time series secondary eclipse spectroscopy of transiting hot Jupiters using the NIRCam slitless grism mode. We use both filters for the longwave grism for all targets except HD189733b, which we only target with the F322W2 filter. Integration times are chosen to keep the counts near 55% the full well depth. We plan 15 minutes of burn in to let the detectors settle and do two hours before and after eclipse to establish the baseline and enable decorrelation of systematics. Simultaneous photometry with the shortwave channel is also obtained.
