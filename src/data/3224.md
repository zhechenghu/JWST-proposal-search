## ABSTRACT

A major assumption in the study of galaxy evolution is that the properties of dust do not evolve with redshift. This informs how we measure obscured star-formation, active supermassive black hole activity, and extinction-corrected line emission in the ultraviolet and optical; however, this assumption remains virtually untested. Do the average properties of dust evolve with redshift? What can the dust emission and absorption tell us about star formation and rest-optical/near-IR attenuation at cosmic noon, z~1-2? We aim to answer these questions with a spectroscopic survey of dust emission in 60 z~1-2 galaxies with MIRI/LRS, which combined with existing Spitzer spectra will produce a complete spectrum between rest-frame 3-12um. This is at least 5-8 times more efficient than using MIRI/MRS to get similar wavelength coverage. The LRS spectra will measure key dust features at ~3um including 3.05um water ice absorption and the 3.3um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature, powerful diagnostics of near-IR attenuation and grain sizes respectively. The full JWST+Spitzer spectrum includes diagnostics on the size, charge, and composition of grains which are only accessible with the complete 3-12um spectral coverage. For the first time we will test how the detailed dust properties in star-forming galaxies change with redshift, as well as position on the star-forming main-sequence and AGN strength. This project will test the properties of dust at cosmic noon in a sample of unprecedented size, and provide a baseline for future studies of dust in galaxies at z=1-6.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose MIRI/LRS slit spectroscopy of 60 dusty, IR-luminous galaxies between z~1-2 spread across three multi-wavelength legacy fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, and xFLS. We aim to detect the 3.3um PAH feature in the LRS spectrum with a SNR of >8 in every source using one exposure per dither, and a single along slit nod dither pattern. We estimate the 3.3um PAH feature flux by taking the lowest predicted value from three scaling relations calibrated in z=0 luminous, IR galaxies and the five z>0 galaxies that have 3.3um PAH detections. These scaling relations are the 3.3um PAH vs. (1) the 6.2um PAH feature, (2) the 11.3um PAH feature, (3) total IR luminosity. We emphasize that this conservative estimate of the 3.3um PAH is low risk because the longer wavelength PAH lines have been detected in the Spitzer/IRS spectra and because robust IRAC Ch.3 and Ch.4 photometry for our sample overlaps the LRS wavelength range, constraining the continuum brightness.
We split our sample into a faint and bright subset, and calculate the exposure time for each assuming the minimum predicted 3.3um PAH feature flux and Spitzer/IRAC 8um flux in the bin. The IRAC 8um filter overlaps with the LRS wavelength range, which helps constrain the expected continuum in the slit, signficantly lowering the risk of non-detections. With this observing strategy, we estimate 3614 seconds of on-source integration time necessary to detect the 3.3um feature in the fainter sub-set of sources, and 906 seconds of on-source integration time in the brightest sub-set. The charged overhead time is 2160 seconds per source on average.
We perform Target Acquisition (TA) using the science targets with guide coordinates from HST/WFC3 and Spitzer/IRAC imaging in the GOODS and xFLS fields. We choose to use the F1500W filter for TA because the Spitzer spectra and photometry show an SED that rises at longer wavelengths, hence F1500W can achieve a greater SNR in a given exposure. We estimate a SNR of>28 in 178 seconds for the faint subset, and a SNR >44 in 45 seconds for the bright subset. The sizes of our sources in the target acquisition filters are expected to be <0.3-0.4", likely point sources given the PSF at 15um is 0.48". The emission we aim to measure in the LRS slit is expected to be co-spatial with the peak in the TA images, so the centroiding algorithm used in placing the slit on-target is ideal for our science goals.
