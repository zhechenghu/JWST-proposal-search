## ABSTRACT

The internal lamp illuminates undispersed MSA images that we capture using a set of four diagnostic shutter patterns. The ALLCLOSED pattern identifies all shutters with "Failed Open" status (those that fail to close when commanded). An ALLOPEN pattern and a pair of checkerboards (CHKBD1x1-1, CHKBD1x1-2) allow recovery of the best-case and worst-case population of "Failed Closed" shutters (those that fail to open when commanded). Each exposure uses NRSIRS2RAPID readout, with 7 groups x 1 integration. The four exposures are acquired monthly to monitor operability trends (failed open and closed shutters) and keep the map used for planning up-to-date. The observations are executed as slew parallels to maximize schedule efficiency. Additionally, a long exposure through the ALLCLOSED configuration is acquired once per year to yield a high dynamic-range contrast map. Note that all configurations should be commanded "pure," i.e., without the previously known shutter failure imprinted onto them by APT/MPT/OPGS (the short mask will still get applied at the hardware level).
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science programs.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

**TITLE**: NIRSpec MSA Operability Monitor
**ID**: CAL-NRS-411

**DESCRIPTION**:
The internal lamp illuminates undispersed MSA images that we capture using a set of four diagnostic shutter patterns. The ALLCLOSED pattern identifies all shutters with "Failed Open" status (those that fail to close when commanded). An ALLOPEN pattern and a pair of checkerboards (CHKBD1x1-1, CHKBD1x1-2) allow recovery of the best-case and worst-case population of "Failed Closed" shutters (those that fail to open when commanded). Each exposure uses NRSIRS2RAPID readout, with 7 groups x 1 integration. The four exposures are acquired monthly to monitor operability trends (failed open and closed shutters) and keep the map used for planning up-to-date. The observations are executed as slew parallels to maximize schedule efficiency. Additionally, a long exposure through the ALLCLOSED configuration is acquired once per year to yield a high dynamic-range contrast map.
Note that all configurations should be commanded "pure," i.e., without the previously known shutter failure imprinted onto them by APT/MPT/OPGS (the short mask will still get applied at the hardware level).

**JUSTIFICATION**:
During MOS observation planning, the MPT uses the MSA operability maps to prevent users from allocating targets to Failed Closed shutters and avoid contamination of science data by the parasitic throughput of Failed Open shutters. These operability maps are vital to MOS planning and must be updated regularly.

**TIMING CONSTRAINTS**:
Special requirements (“between dates" 5th to 26th per month) are in place for each epoch to ensure an approximately monthly cadence throughout the year. The high contrast map has a broad special requirement on time (“between dates" Nov 2025 to April 2026) to ensure that the cadence is approximately yearly.
