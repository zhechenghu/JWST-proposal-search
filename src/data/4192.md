## ABSTRACT

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are small dust grains that have an oversized influence on the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. Particularly crucial are their role as a catalyst for molecular hydrogen formation, the fuel for new stars, and in regulating the heating and ionization balance of interstellar gas. In turn, PAHs respond to the local radiation field, dominated by young stars, and have been a workhorse tracer of obscured star formation rates at high redshift. This relationship may be fundamental to the peak in cosmic star formation at cosmic noon and can finally be explored with JWST. We propose an efficient program with MIRI/LRS slit spectroscopy to observe two prominent PAH features (at 3.3 and 6.2um) in 22 CO-selected, main sequence galaxies at z~1. These features will 1) evaluate the local "universality" between PAHs and molecular gas under the ISM conditions at cosmic noon, 2) break degeneracies between average grain properties and the radiation field, and 3) tie those grain properties to a galaxy's ability to efficiently form stars. This proposal will set the benchmark for future high redshift studies using dust emission, particularly via the 3.3um PAH which is new discovery space for JWST at high redshift and is the only dust feature that JWST can observed up to z~6 and beyond.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program observes the 3.3 and 6.2um PAH dust emission features in 22 CO-selected, main-sequence galaxies at 0.6<z<1.6 with MIRI/LRS slit spectroscopy. Targets are selected from PHIBSS (Tacconi+18, Freundlich+19) in the GOODS-N and COSMOS fields, and sources from the literature in GOODS-N (Pope+13, Magdis+12). Targets are observed at 5-14um with R~40-160. The LRS slit is mosaiced in the case of extended sources (mid-IR sizes are projected to range from 0.2-0.8"). Background subtraction will be done using portions of the slit mosaics that don't contain sources. Exposure times are aimed at detecting the weaker 3.3um feature at S/N>8 over the line or the 4um continuum at S/N>5, whichever requires more time. Line widths and strengths are predicted based on local correlations with total infrared luminosity (Lai+20). Restricted positions angles are set for sources that are elongated or to keep a contaminating nearby source out of the slit. Target acquisition is used for the smallest (d<0.4") targets; the blind pointing accuracy is sufficient for the more extended sources.
