## ABSTRACT

```
This program will acquire the spectroscopic (lamp) flats for the FS mode using the ALLSLITS subarray. Observations will be acquired for all of the NIRSpec disperser/lamp combinations. These observations are essential for minimizing flat field calibration noise for FS and/or BOTS observations that need improved signal-to-noise. In addition to the commissioning and cycle 1 flats, these flats will further decrease the noise from flat fielding process for science observation processing. The S-flat is one part of the 3 component NIRSpec flat field in addition to the Fflat and the Dflat. This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

```
ALLSLITS exposures taken with all 9 disperser/ lamp configurations (filter set to OPAQUE).
subarray gain is always 2.
Uses internal lamp flat template therefore parallel slew only special requirement is required.
The flat field response is purely a property of the detector pixel, therefore data for other subarrays can be cutout of the ALLSLITS subarray.
Sub2048 and Sub512 are used with prism and medium gratings because S1600A1 will saturate too quickly.
Integrations are selected to avoid saturation.
cycle through all exposures with a particular grating before moving on to minimize GWA moves.
All exposures are in a single visit. Total time investment for high S/N flats is approximately 1.2 hours.
