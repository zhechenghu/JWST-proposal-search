## ABSTRACT

The spectroscopic confirmation of numerous galaxies already quiescent at z=3.5-4 defies our understanding of the early evolution of massive galaxies. State-of-the-art cosmological simulations struggle to reproduce the number densities and properties of such quiescent objects at increasing redshift, and completely fail at z~4. While ground-based observations have been instrumental to drive the initial study of these intriguing galaxies, they are largely insufficient to derive robust stellar velocity dispersions, ages, metallicities, and rest-frame optical sizes, all fundamental ingredients to understand the physics regulating their life cycle. Here we propose to derive all these quantities for a fully representative sample of 11 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies at z=3.5-4 with NIRSpec/MSA medium resolution spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging. The proposed observations will allow us to (1) detect slight short-timescale SFR residuals or faint AGN from emission lines; (2) derive stellar ages, metallicities, and robustly reconstruct SFHs via spectro-photometric modeling; (3) determine their stellar structure and dynamics by measuring velocity dispersion and sizes; (4) establish the existence of surrounding overdense environments, as expected given their large stellar masses. JWST is the only facility that can allow us to achieve these goals, as this program is unfeasible from the ground. This deep multiplexing spectroscopic search will have high legacy value as all main targets are in some of the most intensely studied cosmological fields with exquisite ancillary coverage and plenty of potentially interesting fillers for the MSA.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose to observe 11 spectroscopically confirmed quiescent objects at z=3.5-4 with NIRSpec MSA with the medium resolution grism G235M+F170LP. The MSA observations are implemented using a combination of groups and exposures tailored to the brightness of each object. When not available in the archive, we request NIRCam imaging in the F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W filters to position the slits and measure the sizes of the targets.
