## ABSTRACT

Internal lamp observations (executed during slews to minimize impact) are used to monitor the status of NIRSpec MSA shutter operability and hence allow update of MSA operability masks (failed open and failed closed shutters) used in observation planning and pipeline reduction. Undispersed MSA images, illuminated by the internal lamp, are taken through a set of four diagnostic shutter patterns. An ALLCLOSED pattern is used to find all shutters that are “Failed Open” (fail to close when commanded). An ALLOPEN pattern and a pair of checkboards (CHKBD1x1-1, CHKBD1x1-2) are used to recover the best-case and worst-case population of “Failed Closed” shutters (those that fail to open when commanded). Each exposure uses NRSIRS2RAPID readout, with 7 groups x 1 integration. The set of four exposures are acquired every month to monitor trends in operability and keep the map used for planning up-to-date. The observations are executed as slew parallels to maximize efficiency. An additional long exposure through the ALLCLOSED configuration is obtained once per year, to yield a high dynamic-range contrast map.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

TITLE: NIRSpec MSA Operability Monitor
ID: CAL-NRS-304
DESCRIPTION:
Internal lamp observations (executed during slews to minimize impact) are used to monitor the status of NIRSpec MSA shutter operability and hence allow update of MSA operability masks (failed open and failed closed shutters) used in observation planning and pipeline reduction. Undispersed MSA images, illuminated by the internal lamp, are taken through a set of four diagnostic shutter patterns. An ALLCLOSED pattern is used to find all shutters that are “Failed Open” (fail to close when commanded). An ALLOPEN pattern and a pair of checkboards (CHKBD1x1-1, CHKBD1x1-2) are used to recover the best-case and worst-case population of “Failed Closed” shutters (those that fail to open when commanded). Each exposure uses NRSIRS2RAPID readout, with 7 groups x 1 integration. The set of four exposures are acquired every month to monitor trends in operability and keep the map used for planning up-to-date. The observations are executed as slew parallels to maximize efficiency. An additional long exposure through the ALLCLOSED configuration is obtained once per year, to yield a high dynamic-range contrast map.
Note that all configurations should be commanded "pure", i.e. without the previously known shutter failure imprinted on to them by APT/MPT/OPGS. (The short mask will still be applied at the hardware level).
JUSTIFICATION:
During MOS observation planning, the MPT uses the MSA operability maps to prevent users allocating targets to Failed Closed shutters and also to avoid contamination of science data by the parasitic throughput of Failed Open shutters. This is a vital component of MOS planning, and the operability maps need to be updated regularly.
