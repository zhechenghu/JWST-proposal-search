## ABSTRACT

This program provides internal lamp flat observations to be carried out during slews. These observations allow a direct comparison with ground-based data taken in the CV3 and OTIS testing to see whether the detector properties have changed. This continues program 1503 from cycle 1 and program 4472 from cycle 2.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The observations in the program are individual internal lamp exposures through the different NIRISS imaging filters. These observations done during slews in the hope that few stars will be "seen" in the images and thus to save time on the observations. The exposures are the same as was used in CV3 ground testing and in cycles 1 and 2, and will be directly compared with the previous observations to determine if there are overall changes in the detector properties.
