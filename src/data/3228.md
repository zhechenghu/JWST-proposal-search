## ABSTRACT

To date, observations of both planet-forming disks and exoplanets show a large degree of chemical heterogeneity. Many observed disks have gas-phase compositions inconsistent with known exoplanets' atmospheric compositions. Is this discrepancy real? And are chemical variations across known disks intrinsic or are they instead a result of an incomplete or unrepresentative sample? And if they prove real, what are the most important physical mechanisms driving disk composition? We propose to address these questions by analyzing sensitive JWST MIRI spectroscopy for a sample of 40 disks whose chemistry will be surveyed with ALMA as part of the Disk-Exoplanet C/Onnection Cycle 9 Large Program. While the ALMA program proposes to constrain the outer disk C/O ratio, only with JWST MIRI is it possible to determine the composition, including C/O, of the terrestrial planet forming zone. By combining ALMA, JWST archival data (18 disks), and the observations proposed here (22 disks), this program has the potential to unlock not only how diverse are planet forming environments, but also the physical/chemical origins of this diversity.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose to use JWST MIRI MRS to observe 22 disks targeted as part of the ALMA Disk-Exoplanet C/Onnection Large Program, 13 within the Lupus star forming region and 9 within Taurus. Our lines of interest span the full MIRI range and thus we require full spectral scans of our sources from 5-28 micron. To detect the lines of interest requires SNR of 300 at 15 micron and >100 at 20 micron. Each observation begins with Target Acquisition and utilizes simultaneous imaging (with the F1000W filter to avoid saturation) to improve pointing accuracy and minimize fringing. Since we expect the inner disk mid-IR emission to be essentially point-like to MIRI, we adopt a four-point dither and do not carry out a dedicated background observation per source. Based on our ETC calculations, we adopt a FASTR1 readout pattern. The targets are grouped based on their known or expected mid-IR brightness, setting the exact ratio of groups and integrations to optimize for cosmic ray mitigation (faint sources) or saturation (bright sources).
