## ABSTRACT

In its first months of activity, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST ) has shown to the whole astronomical community its great performance in terms of sensitivity and resolution, enabling the detection of the first statistical samples of galaxies at redshift z > 5. To date, our knoweledge of the physical properties of these objects is still strongly limited to the brightest and most massive galaxies. Thanks to JWST and the proposed observations, we will finally reach and characterise the main properties of the bulk of the galaxy population at such high redshifts: the low/intermediate mass galaxies.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal aims at obtaining NIRCam spectroscopy in the wavelength range 2.4-5.1 micron for three well-known lensing clusters: Abell 2774 (A2744), Abell 370 (A370) and MACS J0416.1-2403 (M0416). We ask the observations to be carried out in the NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) mode with both dispersion grisms, i.e. GRISMR and GRISMC.
The use of two grisms with orthogonal disperison directions is fundamental in the crowdedness of the galaxy cluster environment since it allows to mitigate possible effects of spectra contamination due to close-by sources.
We choose the NIRCam WFSS over the use of the NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Array (MSA) since the NIRCam grism allows for a sample completness that is unparalleled by the NIRSpec/MSA.
We choose as targets A2744, A370 and M0416 since these are well studied lensing clusters characterised by a rich ancillary dataset. In fact, high-quality imaging coming from NIRCam as well as from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on-board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is available for all the three clusters.
This multi-wavelength imaging is complemented by spectroscopic information from the MUSE instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and from NIRISS on-board JWST.
Consequently, these three galaxy clusters have already available robust lensing models.
Together with this wealth of ancillary data and the existing lensing models, the proposed JWST observations will enable us to reach the main goal of our research: to study and characterise the physical properties of low/intermediate mass galaxies at z > 5.
Because of the clear legacy value of these observations, we do not request proprietary time.
