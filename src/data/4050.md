## ABSTRACT

Here we propose a NIRCam coronagraphic survey of stars within the TW Hya association which will be sensitive to sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets beyond 20 au. JWST is the only observatory with the necessary wavelength coverage and infrared sensitivity to explore this population, and holds the key to exploring their demographics, histories, and atmospheres. These observations will provide the first ever constraint on the occurrence of sub-Jupiter exoplanets beyond 10 au, and are fundamental to our understanding of the demographics of the entire exoplanet population. These constraints will in turn clarify whether the observed gaps within ALMA disks are likely to be generated by the sculpting effects of planets, and will provide valuable information on the influence of planetary scattering, which may be responsible for measured over-abundances of free-floating planets. Finally, these observations will kickstart a new generation of follow-up imaging and/or spectroscopic JWST characterisation observations of discovered objects. With sensitivity to masses as low as 0.1 Mjup at temperatures of 250K, these exoplanets will be fundamentally distinct from any other discovered thus far.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose NIRCam dual-band coronagraphic imaging of 24 targets with the TW Hya association using the MASK335R with the F200W+F444W filters. The sample of targets will be separated into seven non-interruptible sequences for spectral types A, K, M1-M2, M3, M4, M5-6, and M9. Each sequence will also include observations of a bright reference target with a matching spectral type using the 9-POINT-CIRCLE dither pattern to facilitate optimal PSF subtraction through reference differential imaging (RDI). PSF subtraction through self-referencing within and across sequences will also be explored to potentially enhance the dedicated reference observations. Exposures will be set to approximately 30 minutes for each target, and reference observations will have an exposure duration that corresponds to producing the same signal-to-noise as the brightest science target within their respective sequence. The precise readout parameters for each observation have been optimised through our PanCAKE simulations for each target. This exposure time and reference strategy provides a median mass sensitivity of ~0.15 Mjup at 1" and ~0.1 Mjup in the background limited regime beyond ~3". Target acquisitions will be performed in the F335M filter, with some targets requiring the use of the ND square to avoid saturation. Readout parameters for these observations were optimised using ETC calculations within the workbook 146869, and all target acquisitions reach a signal-to-noise of >100 to ensure an optimal PSF subtraction. Prior to the science observations, we will also perform full frame astrometric confirmation imaging to ensure that our target is correctly centered behind the coronagraphic mask.
