## ABSTRACT

Very low-mass stars (VLMS, spectral type later than M3) are known as favorable hosts of small planets, which are now being intensively studied with JWST. To fully understand the formation, evolution, and chemical compositions of these planets, it is essential to examine the physical and chemical properties of their birthplaces - the disks surrounding VLMS. The exceptional sensitivity of JWST has opened new avenues for investigating these faint VLMS disks, revealing rich and diverse C, O chemistry in their inner regions. One prevailing hypothesis links the variations in gas chemistry to the structure of the outer disk, which controls the inward drift efficiency of icy pebbles and the delivery of water. However, the current JWST VLMS sample is dominated by disks that are faint at millimeter wavelengths, making it difficult to characterize their outer disk structures. To thoroughly test the influence of outer disk structures on inner gas chemistry, we propose MIRI/MRS observations towards a complementary sample of mm-bright disks around VLMS, for which high-resolution ALMA images are already available. By conducting a joint analysis of high-quality JWST and ALMA data, we aim to test if disks with a high inner gas C/O ratio exhibit deep/wide gaps that inhibit pebble drift, while sources with prominent water emission display only shallow features that allow icy pebbles to continue flowing inward.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request MIRI/MRS observations for 12 disks in the young Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions. We will use all three grating settings to cover the full wavelength range from 5 to 28 micron. As we focus on the detection of faint molecular emission lines, the exposure time for each disk is set to reach SNR of ~200 at 17 micron. Each observation will start with target acquisition to place the source at the center of the IFU field of view. The standard 4-point dither is adopted as the line emission of interest is expected to be unresolved.
