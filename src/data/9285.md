## ABSTRACT
Observations of the zodiacal background are being taken to produce sky flats for the NIRISS F140M and F158M filters.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
These observations are intended to allow on-sky zodiacal flat field images to be made in the NIRISS F140M and F158M filters. NIRCam is taken as the primary instrument because the dither patterns available are better than what is available when NIRISS is prime. This is continuation of programs 1475, 4443, and 6657 from previous cycles.
