## ABSTRACT

One of the more surprising results from Cycle 1 was the discovery of broad-line AGN at z>5 with luminosities and black hole (BH) masses that are 2-3 dex below those of bright quasars found from the ground. These faint quasars are more representative of the underlying BH population and are the key to constraining models of BH seeding, the contribution of AGN to reionization, and the early coevolution of galaxies and BHs. What we currently know about these sources is based on a limited sample (~20 broad-line AGN with R>1000 spectroscopy) that is likely biased toward the most massive and active BHs due to non-uniform target selection in Cycle 1 that favored observing brighter sources. We request 20.5 hours of NIRSpec observations to carry out a systematic census of both unobscured and obscured low-luminosity quasars at z>5 via the detection of their broad-line emission. We have compiled a target sample of 55 unobscured AGN candidates and 77 dust-reddened AGN candidates (sources known as "little red dots”). We will observe 55 of these sources in 6 MSA pointings, which will quadruple the current sample of faint quasars with R>1000 spectroscopy. Our requested 2 hour exposures will be sensitive to BH masses down to 1.7x10^6 Msol. We will use our resulting sample to: (1) make the most robust estimate yet of the BH mass function at the low-mass end, which constrains models of BH seeding and their growth history, (2) constrain the evolution of the local M_BH-M* relationship at the lowest BH masses yet probed, and (3) determine the fraction of little red dots that host broad-line AGN with the most sensitive spectroscopic follow-up of these enigmatic sources yet carried out.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will perform a spectroscopic census of faint quasars using the NIRSpec G395M/F290LP grating/filter pair in order to detect the Ha line out to z=6.7 and the Hb line to z=9.4. Our target field is the portion of the Extended Groth Strip imaged by the CEERS survey. In order to detect a broad emission line with a FWHM=1000 km/s from a 1.7x10^6 Msol black hole, we require an exposure time of 7090.2 seconds (~2 hours). To achieve this integration time, we will use a detector setup of 16 groups/integration and 2 integrations/exposure with the NRSIRS2 readout pattern. We will use a 3-shutter slitlet for each source, coupled with a 3-position nod pattern, following the strategy that the CEERS survey. We find we can observe roughly 9-10 of our primary targets per MSA pointing. In order to achieve our required sample size, we will observe 6 seperate MSA pointings over the CEERS field. To decide on field centers, we prioritize AGN candidates with compact morphologies, with lower weights used for extended sources. Filler targets are chosen from the CEERS dataset, with the highest filler priority given to a sample of sources at z>8.5, then galaxies with photometric redshifts that would place Ha or Hb visible in the G395M spectrum, and finally progressively lower weights assigned to sources with increasing F444W magnitude and decreasing redshift.
