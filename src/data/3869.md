## ABSTRACT

Fast and powerful outflows may quench coeval star formation in galaxies, impact galaxy morphology and the circumgalactic medium, and regulate supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. The likely culprits, fast-accreting quasars, are common at the epoch of peak SMBH accretion but rare locally, making it hard to catch and study this phenomenon in action, even with JWST. Fortunately, there are notable exceptions: local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Clear unambiguous signatures of outflows have been detected in these objects on all scales, ranging from X-ray/UV winds on sub-pc scales to galaxy-wide cold-molecular, cool-atomic, and warm-ionized outflows which extend to 10+ kpc. The energetics of these outflows scale with quasar power but current data are still missing the critically important coronal-ionized and warm-molecular gas phases to determine if the quasars in these systems actually affects the host evolution. The planned MIRI/MRS observations of a representative set of 13 local ULIRGs with the most robust outflow energetics to date will be analyzed with the JWST-optimized PSF decomposition software package q3dfit to (1) get an accurate and complete census of the outflow energetics, (2) constrain the dominant mechanisms that launch these outflows and their duty cycles, and (3) characterize the impact of the quasar outflow and intense radiation field on the physical state of the host ISM, coeval star formation activity, and circumgalactic medium. These exquisite data will serve as local templates to help interpret the coarser data from on-going JWST studies of distant obscured quasars. The proprietary period is shortened given the legacy value of the data.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe 11 ULIRGs with MIRI/MRS using the following strategy:

*   We use of the SHORT, MEDIUM, and LONG wavelength settings for all pointings except for two objects which already have the SHORT setting.
*   We use the FASTR1 readout mode for all observations.
*   We use the 4-point all-wavelength extended source dither pattern for the on-source data cube.
*   We obtain a background cube immediately after each on-source cube using the same settings as the on-source data cube, except for using the 2-point dither to save time and overhead.
*   On-source exposures are (40 groups/integration) x (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 integrations/exposure) x (4 dither positions)
*   Background exposures are (40 groups/integration) x (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 integrations/exposure) x (2 dither positions)
*   We select the highly recommended simultaneous imaging with the F770W during all MIRI/MRS observations to improve astrometric accuracy and thus cube building.
