## ABSTRACT

Alpha Centauri A is the closest solar-type star to the Sun and offers an unique opportunity to detect both a mature gas giant planet (consistent with existing radial velocity constraints) and a zodiacal dust cloud. A carefully planned observational sequence using the MIRI Coronagraph (F1550C) and innovative post-processing would be sensitive down to a radius limit of 0.5~0.7 R-Jupiter for planets within ~3 AU (~2.5") around alpha Cen A where models predict a region of stablity against disruption by alpha Cen B. These same observations would be sensitive to a level of zodiacal emission only a few times brighter than that of the Sun's, an unprecedented level not even achieved by ground based interferometers. The proposed observations would probe the limit of JWST high contrast imaging on a star that offers the best chance for the ultimate detection of Earth analogs by future ground and/or space based facilities. The experiment is admittedly high risk, but the prospect of directly imaging a planet around our closest stellar neighbor is an exciting one.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The proposed scenario brackets the observations of alpha Cen with observations of a PSF reference star, eps Muscae, of comparable brightness to alpha Cen A. The date of the observation has been selected with a window of a few days to minimize the change in pitch angle (solar offset) between the target and reference star so as to minimize changes in telescope's thermal environment.

Eps Mus will be observed with a 9 point dither pattern at the position of alpha Cen A behind the coronagraphic mask to increase the image diversity for improved PSF reconstruction. Our simulations ahve shown tht the diversity in the reference star PSF was of higher priority than eliminating the low level of residual speckles from alpha Cen B. The observation of alpha Cen is split to avoid the limit of 10,000 seconds for an individual observation.

Target acquisition (TA) for both alpha Cen and the PSF reference star eps Mus will be challenging due to two factors: 1) both stars are extremely bright and would saturate during the TA process; 2) the position of alpha Cen A is changing by 10 mas per day due to its combined proper motion, parallax and orbital motion. We address the first point for both stars by using nearby Gaia stars as the initial target to be followed by an offset to the desired science or reference target. Offsets are given after rotation into the camera coordinate system using the SIAF tool. To make the rotation calculation fully deterministic we have specified a desired roll angle. However, we note that the angle itself and the exact timing of the observatiosn are somehwat arbitrary. We just need to know the values in enough time to be able to calculate the requisite offsets. The Gaia stars and eps Mus have highly precise Gaia positions and proper motions. We will address the evolving position of alpha Cen A using the ALMA astrometry obtained by Akeson et al (2020) along with the results of an approved ALMA DDT proposal to update the position of alpha Cen about 6 weeks before the scheduled observation. We will update the offsets once the exact date of the observation is known..

The offset star for alpha Cen A is a Gaia star located (13") away in (2023) away with an inferred K magnitude (from Gaia colors) of K=13.6. It is observed in TA for FQPM/F1550 mode with F560W and achieves SNR~140 in 15 sec. The offset star for eps Mus is a Gaia star located 25" away with an inferred K magnitude (from Gaia colors) of K=11.4. It is observed in TA for FQPM/F1550 mode with F560W and achieves SNR~32 in 8 sec.

A number of interloper stars will appraoch alpha Cen A during the next few years due to alpha Cen's large proper motion. One is quite faint (S2) and is a minor issue in 2022-23. A second (S5) is significantly brighter and becomes a more serious issue in 2026 and beyond. For this reason we want to schedule the observations as early as possible to ensure the maximum areal coverage for exoplanet discovery and the potential for future follow-up observations.

We have elected to use two roll angles as recommended for MIRI coronography.

**5/31/2023.** uPDATED ROLL ANGLES AND v3 AS REQUETED. OBSERVATOIN DATE ASSUMED TO START AT 7/28/2023 00:00:00

**6/29/2023:**
1) Set roll angle at 8 degrees. Observatoins assumed to start at 7/26/2023 at 0800 UT
2) Selected guide stars based on F1000W test frames for both eps Mus
3) Incorporated ALMA positions for alpha cen using parallax correction appropriate for JWST whose positoin is taken frm Horizons database
4) Set PA for BACKGROUND observations to be the same as primary science observations.

5) removed offsets from eps ms bkgnd observatsoin (in error)

**7/25/2024**
Numerous updates due to rescheduling.
1) offset strategy validated during test observations #61 and #62
2) selected Gaia stars based on avoidance of dffraction spikes for gven roll angles
3) extended date of obervation by 27 hours to enable roll angle V3=112.7d which brings in 2 guide stars for obervation #56
4) dropped from 5pt to 9pt dither for second eps Mus observatoin to allow time to put eps Mus at position of AcenB for better PSF rejection.
