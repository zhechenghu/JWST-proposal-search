## ABSTRACT

Cycle 3 showed that we can obtain higher-quality Imager darks by allowing the persistence from idle to decay prior to the first dark exposure. As we await data from CAL-MIRI-301 to help determine the best method for subtracting the dark current, we choose to obtain 10 exposures in SLOWR1 and FASTR1 for the Full frame in all 3 detectors. Unlike cycle 3, we include all subarrays.

As in CAL-MIRI-300, we schedule the FASTR1 Imager darks after allowing the persistence to decay, by putting the SLOWR1 darks with all detectors first as the MRS detectors are less affected by the persistence, and the readout mode is used overall less often for the Imager.

We plan the observations with no timing constraints as these must be obtained as prime, which is to our benefit as we wish to exercise the CCC more often.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Cycle 3 showed that we can obtain higher-quality Imager darks by allowing the persistence from idle to decay prior to the first dark exposure. As we await data from CAL-MIRI-301 to help determine the best method for subtracting the dark current, we choose to obtain 10 exposures in SLOWR1 and FASTR1 for the Full frame in all 3 detectors. Unlike cycle 3, we include all subarrays.

As in CAL-MIRI-300, we schedule the FASTR1 Imager darks after allowing the persistence to decay, by putting the SLOWR1 darks with all detectors first as the MRS detectors are less affected by the persistence, and the readout mode is used overall less often for the Imager.

We plan the observations with no timing constraints as these must be obtained as prime, which is to our benefit as we wish to exercise the CCC more often.

COMMENT: There will be an error with the "NO slew" special requirement.
Indeed the SR in the future should be called â€œNo-slew in a Prime Visit", something we talked with Modhumita Sabata,
to implement for the Darks. The Darks cannot be done in parallel, they cannot fit in a regular slew time slot, so they need to
be done as Prime, and without slewing. So we do need to WAIVE the error.
The usage of the CCC is correct, the last visit in a group will OPEN the CCC.
