## ABSTRACT

This activity observes a bright, extended planetary nebula to provide illumination throughout the MIRI MRS FOV in order to derive flatfields. This target is new compared to NGC 7027 observed during Cycle 1 (PID 1523) and Cycle 2 (PID 4489). This planetary nebula is fainter and larger than NGC 7027 in order to obtain longer ramps and to have less spatial variations in the MRS FOV. Observations are obtained using a dithered mosaic in order to sample the same locations on the sky with many different detector pixels (required for self-calibration).

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program observes the planetary nebula IC 418 in a 3x3 mosaic to measure the MRS flatfields in a single non-interruptible sequence of target and background.
