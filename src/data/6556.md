## ABSTRACT

This target is formed by two galaxies that display tidal tails and triggered star formation associated with a galaxy collision. Spitzer data reveals a bridge of starlight between the system and tidal tails. The NIRCam and MIRI data will provide the highest resolution and sensitive infrared images of the entire system. The NIRCam images will trace the location of the older stellar population in each galaxy, as well as the bridge of stars that connect the galaxies. The MIRI image will reveal star forming regions triggered by the galactic collision in detail for the first time, as well as the galaxy dust content.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal will use the NIRCam and MIRI imaging modes to obtain multi-band imaging to be released in 2024. The images must be sufficiently deep to allow for the creation of low-noise color-composite images. The dither patterns are optimized for uniform depth, efficient removal of cosmic rays and other artifacts. These criteria will also produce very high-quality, science-ready data products for use by the community. This proposal does not include spectroscopic observations.
