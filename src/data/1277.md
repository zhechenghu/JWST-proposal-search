## ABSTRACT

    In order to answer questions such as: What is the origin of the observed exoplanet diversity? How and where did exoplanets form? What are they made of? Do they have an atmosphere? Are the atmospheric composition and temperature indicative of an environment which could host life? and ultimately: Are there any signatures of life in the exoplanet spectra?, we have to go beyond the sole detection and characterization of exoplanets in terms of basic parameters, e.g. radius, mass and orbital dynamics, and get crucial information by characterizing their atmosphere using spectroscopic observations over a broad wavelength range from visible to mid-Infrared. In this program, we will study the atmosphere of four exoplanets detected by direct imaging; HD 95046 b, GJ 504b, HD106906b and Ross 458C. The disks around HD95046 and HD106906 will also be studied.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    We will use coronagraphic MIRI observations for HD 95086b, GJ 504b and the disk of HD106906. For the coronagraphic observations of GJ 504b and HD106906 at 15.50 microns, we will use self reference as the GJ 504b and the disk of HD106906 are in a different portion in the coronagraph. HD106906b will be observed with MIRI LRS and with NIRSPEC. We will also perform MIRI MRS observations of Ross 458C, completed by NIRSPEC observations at shorter wavelengths.
