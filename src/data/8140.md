## ABSTRACT

The frontier of brown dwarf studies is the accurate determination of their atmospheric compositions. However, this task is challenging, as the spectra of L and T brown dwarfs are influenced by silicate clouds, which causes their spectroscopically measured compositions to differ from these objects' actual bulk compositions. To tackle these challenges, we propose NIRSPEC/PRISM and MIRI/LRS 0.6--14 um spectroscopy for 16 carefully selected high-mass benchmark brown dwarfs, spanning the full L and T spectral types. These brown dwarfs orbit well-characterized FGK parent stars with uniformly measured stellar abundances across sub-solar to super-solar values, providing us with precise bulk compositions (C/O, [M/H], Mg/Si) from their parent stars, making them unique benchmarks for silicate cloud physics.

(1) Our targets --- including four L0--L2, eight L3--L9, and four T5--T9 benchmark brown dwarfs --- trace the physics of silicate clouds at temperatures before, during, and after cloud condensation. By measuring their C/O and [M/H] from our JWST observations, we will establish the first empirical calibration linking the observable and bulk compositions across the full cloud formation cycle.

(2) Our L3--L9 targets, with their silicate cloud features uniquely probed by MIRI, will allow us to investigate the causal relationship between bulk compositions and the specific types of silicate clouds that form in their atmospheres, directly assessing modern cloud formation theories.

These observations will produce a legacy spectroscopic dataset, offering quantitative context for atmospheric and formation studies of directly imaged exoplanets.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Our program will obtain NIRSPEC/PRISM and MIRI/LRS 0.6--14 um spectroscopy for 16 L0-T9 benchmark brown dwarfs at a resolution of R$~$100. The widely separated ($>10"$) parent stars of our targets ensure that their spectroscopic observations will not be affected by contaminating starlight.

Our NIRSPEC target acquisition will achieve S/N>40 for each target. We will use the WATA acquisition mode, the CLEAR filter, the NRSRAPID (J=14-16 mag) or NRSRAPIDD6 (J=16-19 mag) readout patterns, and the SUB32 subarray. For the two faintest targets (J>18 mag), we will use the SUB2048 subarray along with the NRSRAPID readout pattern.

The NIRSPEC/PRISM observations will achieve S/N>100 in 3-4 um for L0-L9 targets and S/N>100 in 4-5 um for T5-T9 targets. Spectra of this quality will precisely trace spectral features of key atmospheric molecules, enabling reliable measurements of [M/H] and C/O ratios. We will use PRISM/CLEAR, the NRSRAPID readout pattern, the S200A1 slit, the SUBS200A1 subarray, and the AB nodding pattern.

Our MIRI target acquisition will achieve S/N>40 for each target. We will use the F560W filter for L0-L9 targets and the F1000W filter for T5-T9 targets, along with the FAST readout pattern.

The MIRI/LRS observations will achieve S/N>50 at 9 um for the cloudy L3-L9 targets and S/N>100 in 5-8 um for L0-L2 and T5-T9 targets. These high-quality spectra will allow us to determine the specific types of silicate clouds present in the atmospheres of L3-L9 targets, and reliably measure C/O and [M/H] across all L0-T9 targets by combining MIRI/LRS with NIRSPEC/PRISM. We will use the Full subarray, the FASTR1 readout pattern, and an AB nodding pattern.
