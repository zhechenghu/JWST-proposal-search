## ABSTRACT

We request JWST imaging for a golden sample of 16 massive galaxies at z=4-5 with existing ALMA [CII] data of the highest quality. The [CII] data reveals regularly rotating disks, allowing for the derivation of rotation curves that trace the total mass distribution. To infer the properties of dark matter (DM) halos, however, we miss a key piece of information: the stellar mass distribution. JWST is the only existing telescope that can spatially resolve the stellar emission in these galaxies. We request MIRI images at rest-frame 1.4 um to set a robust constraint on the stellar mass, as well as NIRCam images in 4 filters to trace surface brightness and color profiles at the same spatial resolution of the ALMA data (0.05"-0.20" corresponding to 0.5-1.0 kpc). We will (1) determine the stellar mass distribution, subtracting any potential central AGN contribution, (2) fit the [CII] rotation curves with mass models accounting for the contributions of stars, gas, and DM, (3) study the evolution of scaling laws such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the radial acceleration relation, and more, (4) study star formation (SF) laws using maps of the total SF rate from rest-frame NUV images (from NIRCam) plus existing FIR maps (from ALMA) together with gas maps from [CII] data, (5) study the environment of these massive galaxies, which are expected to live in the densest regions of the early Universe, detecting possible low-mass satellites. This program will exploit the JWST-ALMA synergy to probe the total mass content (stars, gas, and DM) of massive galaxies at z=4-5. This will provide key clues on the DM nature by tracing DM halos in a cosmic epoch that has been out of reach until now.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal aims to obtain standard NIRCam and MIRI imaging for a sample of 16 galaxies at z=4-5.

The NIRCam imaging will be done with two filter sets (F150W+F444W and F200W+F277W). We requests a SHALLOW4 readout patter, 5 groups per integration, and 4 sub-pixel dithers.

The MIRI imaging requests the F770W filter, FASTR1 readout pattern, 42 groups with 2 integrations, and cycling dither types with 4 pointings.
