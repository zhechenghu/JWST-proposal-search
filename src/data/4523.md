## ABSTRACT

Titan's atmosphere is unique in the solar system - the only solid body world with a cycle of methane weather. Titan's year is 29.5 times longer than that of the Earth, caused by the length of Saturn's orbit, combined with a 27 degree obliquity. In this proposal we will renew observations of Titan's weather close to equinox (2025) searching for signatures of clouds in several narrow band filters able to penetrate to the lower atmosphere, between strong NIR absorptions of methane. Comparison of results to Titan GCMs will inform us as to how well our models can replicate its climate, and what further refinements are necessary.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

NIRCam - observations in three narrow band filters (F187N, F212N, F466N) and one medium band filter (F300M) to search for clouds in the lower atmospher around the time of equinox. At the previous equinox, 15 years ago, Titan displayed a dramatic change in cloud appearance.
