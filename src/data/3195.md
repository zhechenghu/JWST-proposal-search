## ABSTRACT
    The existence of iron and stony-iron meteorites, as well as our current understanding of planet formation, indicate that many of the early planetesimals must have been sufficiently heated to have undergone differentiation and core formation. The remnants of this process â€“ the parent bodies of the iron meteorites - should be present in the asteroid belt in the form of large core and core/mantle fragments. The M-type asteroids have been hypothesized to represent such objects, but results the past decade continue to reveal that the reality is more complicated than this simple picture. The compositional information that can be obtained from the ground is limited because M-type asteroids are (by definition) lacking distinctive spectral features in the visible and near-infrared, and the diagnostic mid-IR bands are blocked by telluric absorptions. We propose to obtain 5-28 micron spectra of a representative set of M-type with MIRI/MRS; numerous diagnostic spectral features are present in this range that will differentiate between the candidate hypotheses for the surface mineralogy of these bodies and identify the best spectral match with meteorite classes. The proposed program will address the outstanding question of the composition of the M-type asteroids and whether they are the parent bodies of the iron meteorites.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
    We will obtain 5-28 micron spectra of nine M-Type asteroids using the MIRI/MRS instrument over all spectral channels, in order to determine their mineralogical make-up and their closest spectroscopic match among the meteorite classes. This study will reveal whether any subset of the M class is spectrally similar to iron and stony-iron meteorites, and will shed light on the range of true compositions hidden behind dark featureless vis-NIR spectra.
