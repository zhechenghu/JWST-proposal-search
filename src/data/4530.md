## ABSTRACT

The program is targeting two spectrocopically known lensed galaxies at redshift above 9, ALMA-[OIII] emitter MACS1149-JD1 and Gz9p3, recently identified with JWST. MACS1149-JD1 will be observed with MIRI imager (MIRIM) using the F770W filter, complementing the existing set of JWST data and extending the wavelength coverage to further constrain the stellar populations and SFH. Gz9p3 will be observed both with MIRI and NIRSpec. MIRI imaging with F560W and F770W plus MRS spectroscopy targeting the Halpha+[NII] line. R100 spectroscopy with the NIRSpec integral field spectrograph will be obtained to cover the entire UV-optical range up to the Hbeta and [OIII]5007 line.
