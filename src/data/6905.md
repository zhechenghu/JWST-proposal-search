## ABSTRACT

    Early JWST data on the multi-planet system HR 8799 suggests that a simple JWST NIRCam diagnostic, based on photometric signatures of CO2 and CO abundances, might empirically capture the link between formation processes and composition for directly imaged giant planets. We propose a small program that repeats this early experiment on four other amenable directly imaged systems in order to establish, or rule out, the significance of this tantalizing result, and to sort these companions into the metal-rich or solar-metallicity populations. We will use the wedge-shaped LWBAR coronagraph's "narrow" offset position to image four closely separated companions in the L-T transition. The high throughput of this underutilized mode make this an efficient program that will result in information-rich images of each system at previously invisible wavelengths.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    We will observe four directly imaged exoplanet sysetms, AF Lep b, HD 95086 b, HIP 99770 B, HR 2562 B with the NIRCam LWBAR coronagraph and the F410M, F430M, and F460M filters to measure the relative strength of CO and CO2 absorption in their atmospheres. The observations will yield parallel F210M observations on the SW detector. Each observation will require observing the target with a roll angle offset to faciliate ADI, and a separate PSF reference star to faciliate RDI.

    We have chosen PSF reference stars that are of a similar spectral type, similar brightness, and are nearby on the sky.

    We require PA angles that place the known planets roughly perpendicular to the LWBAR (determined using the JWST CVT).
