## ABSTRACT

This past week brought the discovery of SN 2024aecx, one of the closest stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) ever found, located just 11 Mpc away in NGC 3521. What makes this supernova truly extraordinary is its pre-explosion imaging, available from not only HST but also JWST, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study its progenitor system and environment in remarkable detail. Its rapid spectral evolution suggests it may be an ultra-stripped SN or a peculiar Type Ic, making it an ideal target to study progenitor systems, binary interactions, and dust formation. A carefully timed multi-epoch campaign with JWST will capture the formation of dust precursors, monitor dust evolution, and differentiate between freshly formed and pre-existing dust. These observations will also enable direct detection of the progenitor and any surviving companion, addressing key questions about mass-loss mechanisms, binary systems, and the contribution of SESNe to cosmic dust production. SN 2024aecx represents a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to construct a legacy dataset with transformative implications for stellar evolution and cosmic dust enrichment.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request a total of 32.5 hours charged time to obtain 3 sets of NIR+MIR spectral time-series and 1 set of photometric observations of SN 2024aecx between 30â€“500 days post-explosion.
