## ABSTRACT

Following the epoch of planetary system formation (1-10 Myr), the bodies that were not aggregated by the larger planets remain in orbit around the central star and undergo a long timescale collisional cascade. The systems are void of gas by this time and the collisional processing provides a continuous source of micron size dust particles. These disks of particles, ranging in size from microns to kilometers, are called debris disks.

The Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide us images of nearby debris disks at HST-like resolution at near-infrared wavelengths, with great sensitivity. The technological advancements enable us to study the composition of the solid particles in these systems. Multi-wavelength scattered light imaging will reveal the water-ice, carbon-dioxide ice and tholin composition of the dust. While water is necessary for life to emerge in other worlds, tholins have been shown to be common in the outer regions of the solar system. Assessing the similarities and dissimilarities of materials between these systems and our solar system will help place our own world into context.

Within our program, we will observe the following previously well studied (at other wavelengths) systems: HD 181327, HD 107146, HD 10647, HD 61005, and HD 32297.

This program is a continuation of our Cycle 1 PID 1183 program, to complete the filter set of observations, utilizing the simultaneous SW/LW coronagraphy that is to be enabled for Cycle 2.

Note: Programs 1183 and 2780 were merged back together into a single program (under PID 2780) following the commissioning of SW/LW simultaneous coronagraphy. (05/24/23)

Note: Our HD 10647 and HD 10746 observations were augmented in June/2023 with additional MIRI observations, using the F2100W filter.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will obtain NIRCam PSF-template subtracted coronagraphic images of the debris disks of HD 181327, HD 107146, HD 10647, HD 32297, and HD 61005. We observe all of our targets with the same filter set using the same sequence of observations, only varying the number of integrations/groups on each source and the readout modes, which depend on the predicted surface brightness of the disks and coronagraphic residual stellar light. To cover the spectral absorption lines of the systems, we will use the F335M and F444W filters in Cycle 1. For each target, we also observe a nearby and color- and flux-matched PSF reference source, using contemporaneous and identically executed observation sequences. While exact color-matching is not necessary for the longer wavelength observations, it may be relevant up to 3 microns.

Each set of observations is as follows: 1) We observe each target at two orientations, offset by 10 deg. At each orientation, we sequence through the filter set taking a total of 1200 to 1800 s of data per orientation. 2) We then observe the PSF reference at an undefined position angle, at both filters, for around 2100 s per filter, employing a 5 point dither pattern.

We have added Cycle 2 observation, which are meant to use the soon to be enabled simultaneous coronagraphy feature. Currently, we have included the Short and Long Wavelength (SW and LW) observations as separate observations for the Cycle 2 data.
