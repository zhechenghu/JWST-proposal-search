## ABSTRACT

The distinctive vantage point of JWST at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point (L2) allows sampling the full observable disk, permitting the study of short-term phenomena, diurnal processes (across the East-West axis) and latitudinal processes between the hemispheres (including seasonal effects) with excellent spatial resolutions (0.07 arcsec at 2 um). Spectroscopic observations are achievable in the 0.7-5 um spectral region with NIRSpec at a maximum resolving power of 2700. Imaging will be attainable with NIRCam near 2 m, while the nightside will be accessible with several filters in the 0.5 to 2 m. Some science cases include the mapping of the water D/H ratio, investigations of the Martian mesosphere via the characterization of the non-LTE CO2 emission at 4.3 um, high cadence mapping of the variability dust and water ice clouds, and sensitive searches for trace species and hydrated features on the Martian surface.
