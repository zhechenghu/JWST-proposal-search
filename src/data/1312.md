## ABSTRACT

We will construct both transmission and emission spectra of this planet. Transmission studies will be conducted from 0.6-5 microns using two transit observations (when the planet passes in front of the host star). Emission studies will be conducted from 2.8-14 microns using two eclipse observations (when the planet passes behind the host star). The transmission for this planet's atmosphere will be obtained using a combination of NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec SLIT1600 G395H. The emission from this planets atmosphere will be obtained using a combination of NIRSpec SLIT1600 G395H and MIRI LRS slitless mode.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We observe two transits and two eclipses of HAT-P-26 b.

Obs 1 is the NIRISS/SOSS transit with SUBSTRIP256, 7 groups (72% saturation according to ETC), 483 ints, 21239 s. Minimum baseline before and after transit is expected to be 4400 s. F277W exposure with 10 ints follows transit exposure. TA uses SOSSFAINT and NISRAPID with 19 groups (ETC S/N 280).

Obs 3 is the NIRSpec/G395H transit with SUB2048, 48 groups (96% saturation according to ETC), 481 ints, 21269 s. Minimum baseline before and after transit is expcted to be 4415 s. Offset TA star (Gaia DR3 3668036421656699008) is 35 arcsec away from HAT-P-26 (Gaia DR3 3668036348641580288). TA uses SUB32, CLEAR, NRSRAPIDD6 (ETC S/N 141).

Obs 4 is the NIRSpec/G395H eclipse with SUB2048, 48 groups (96% saturation according to ETC), 563 ints, 24895 s. Minimum baseline before and after eclipse is expected to be 6228 s, assuming circular orbit. Baseline is sufficient to accommodate small postitive and negative time shifts reported in the literature, due to uncertain ecentricity. Offset TA star and exposure is identical to Obs 3.

Obs 6 is the MIRI/LRS eclipse with FASTR1, 115 groups (93% saturation according to ETC), 1414 ints, 26086 s. Minimum baseline before and after eclipse is expected to be 6824 s, assuming circular orbit. See eccentricity comment for Obs 4. TA uses F560W and FAST with 12 groups (S/N 347). LRS verification image uses F560W and FASTR1 with 12 groups (ETC S/N 347).

Special requirements. Our adopted orbital period (P=4.2345026 d) comes from Ivshina & Winn (2022ApJS..259...62I), who fitted 21 transits spanning 800 d. Our adopted zero phase (2459670.42417) is within 1 s of the Ivshina & Winn (2022) ephemeris evaluated at orbit 738 (2459670.4241588 = 2456545.361240 + 4.2345026 * 738). Aperture PA ranges for slitless modes (SOSS, LRS) come from ExoCTK tool.

Relevant ETC workbooks are 145716 and 153485.

2023-Jun-06: Added Obs 104, which is a copy of Obs 4. Obs 4 was skipped on 2023-Jun-05 at 01:48:21 UTC due to the guiders being unavailable.
