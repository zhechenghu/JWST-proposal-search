## ABSTRACT

We will obtain broadband imaging with NIRCam and MIRI of an interacting galaxy pair, capturing the tidal tails and new star formation occurring as result of the tidal forces involved. This distinctive system of galaxies is close enough to resolve some details of star formation regions in the tidal tails with JWST.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Because it's a high enough redshift, emission lines are generally redshifted outside of the narrowband filters designed for the local universe, we will use NIRCam broadband filters F090W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, and F444W which will contain stellar continuum, molecular H2 lines, atomic H recombination lines, and PAH lines to varying degrees. MIRI observations will use F770W, F1000W, and F1500W capturing both PAH lines and thermal dust emission. A 2x2 MIRI mosaic covers each of the 3 galaxies in this system as well as the space around them, in order to capture any faint tidal structures, while a single NIRCam tile is sufficient to accomplish the same task.
