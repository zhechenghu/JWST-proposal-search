## ABSTRACT

We propose to make a short observation of a star field in a single NIRISS filter at 1 month intervals to assess the stability of the instrument with time.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe the same position near the south ecliptic pole at one month intervals to assess the stability of the NIRISS detector over time. Inter-comparison of the stellar brightness values over time should show any long term changes in the NIRISS detector response or the overall system response. While some of the stars in the field will be variable, we should be able to eliminate these and make measurements on other stars within the field of view.

The preferred target for this observation is the LMC astrometric field. If it turns out that that field is too crowded, a backup target is provided in the LMC which will be used for the NIRISS focus measurements. A decision about which field is to be used for this program will be made after the commissioning observations allow a better idea of how well the photometry can actually be done in these two fields.
