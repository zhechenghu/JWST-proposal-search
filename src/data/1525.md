## ABSTRACT

This activity will measure the wavelength solution for the MRS by observing a Be star, which have spectra full of hydrogen recombination lines. The Cycle 1 Cal observations build on observations during Commissioning and will be especially helpful at longer wavelengths, where the sensitivity of the MRS is substantially lower.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Objective: confirm and improve MRS wavelength solution derived during commissioning.
