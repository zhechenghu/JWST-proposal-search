## ABSTRACT

    We propose to take advantage of the unique opportunities offered by Pure Parallel Mode to perform a wide area near-infrared spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRISS. We propose a slitless spectroscopy campaign covering 1000 arcmin^2 via bonus parallel observations, providing F150W+F200W rest frame optical 2D spectra and secure redshifts for 60,000 galaxies at 1<z<5. This will be the definitive spectroscopic benchmark from `Cosmic Noon' to `Cosmic Dawn', with good completeness out to z=5, and probing environments from the field to rich proto-clusters. Continuum + emission line spectra will be obtained for galaxies down to low masses, enabling 1D and 2D measures of dust corrected star-formation rates, metallicities, and stellar population ages.
    Such a large area redshift survey will allow us to measure 3D clustering in the cosmic growth era revealing the detailed connection between dark matter halos and assembling baryons. It will also provide a benchmark set of stellar mass functions for complete spectroscopic type defined samples, address the origin of galactic quenching, provide 2D abundance and age measurements of galaxies measuring galactic buildup and provide a census of rare z>11 bright galaxies and other rare objects at all redshifts. The size of the survey will also enable data driven discovery with advanced machine learning approaches revealing novelties and surprises in the early Universe.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    The observations are pure parallel. For each parallel pointing we will take direct and slitless images in each of the F150W and F200W filters. This requires four filter configurations (4 slots) be available for the visit.
    Nominal exposures times per filter: 1203s in in F150W and F200W direct, and 3608s in F150W and F200W grism GR150C
    (this is the goal - average for the survey).
    Mininum exposures times per filter: 430s in in F150W and F200W direct, and 1309s in F150W and F200W grism GR150C.There is no maximum, we will observe for as long as the visit allows.
    We will size each observation exposure to the slots available. We expect each exposure to be broken down in to the sub-dithers of the primary, which is fine and beneficial.
    If 5 filters are available for the visit we will add a second F200W exposure.
    If more than 6 filters are available we will add F115W grism and F115W direct image to extend the wavelength coverage of the spectra down to 1.33μm.
    For > 6 filters we will add othorgonal grism directions in F200W, F150W and F115W as available.
