## ABSTRACT

An absolute flux standard star will be placed on each subarray to measure any count-rate differences between subarray and full frame read-out modes. In each case, a full frame image is taken at the same field point used for the subarray. Every aperture (subarray and full) used for science or calibration is included. This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program includes grouped observations at each subarray field point (imaging, coronagraphy, and grism).

\*\*\*\*\*\* Imaging:
- We use a mix of the Imaging and Engineering Imaging templates.
- All exposures are in F210M+F410M, with RAPID readout. Groups and integrations are varied to achieve approximately the same exposure time between subarrays and the FULL frame.
- We use 4 SUBARRAY\_DITHERS, and no subarray dithers in all cases.
- We use Fiducial point overrides to place the target on the same spot on the detectors between each subarray and its associated FULL frame image.
- Observations at the same field point are grouped to be non-interruptible
- All point-source and extended-source subarrays are included on Module B:
  --- SUB64P B1/B5
  --- SUB160P B1/B5
  --- SUB400P B1/B5
  --- SUB160 B1/B2/B3/B4/B5
  --- SUB320 B1/B2/B3/B4/B5
  --- SUB640 B1/B2/B3/B4/B5
- On Module A, we use just the subarrays used for absolute flux calibration
  --- SUB64P A3/A5
  --- SUB160 A1/A2/A3/A4/A5

\*\*\*\*\*\* Grism:
- Same exposure setup and dithers used for Imaging. Same type of non-interrutible grouping for observations at the same field point.
- All grism subarrays included:
  --- SUBGRISM64 A1/A3/A5
  --- SUBGRISM128 A1/A3/A5
  --- SUBGRISM256 A1/A3/A5

\*\*\*\*\*\* Coronagraphy:
- We use the Coronagraphy Template, with no Target Acquisition.
- All exposures use F210M+F356W and RAPID readout, with groups/integrations changing to acheive approximately the same exposure length.
- We use 5-point dithers (BOX or BAR)
- Same type of non-interrutible grouping for observations at the same field point as used for Imaging & Grism
- We use target offset SRs to put the star outside of the mask
- All Coronagraph subarrays included:
  - SUB640 for MASK210R A2/A5
  - SUB640 for MASKSWB A4/A5
  - SUB320 for MASK335R A2/A5
  - SUB320 for MASK 430R A2/A5
  - SUB400x256 for MASKLWB A4/A5
