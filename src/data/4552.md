## ABSTRACT

The overall goal of this investigation is to complete the study of galaxies in the MACS1149 field by obtaining also the rest frame UV for the high-redshift objects. This is a cycle 3 proposal. Edit number should be 1.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The technical goals of this program are to obtain rest frame UV spectra for the galaxies observed by program 1199. The PA is constrained to be the same as the previous program (GTO1199), to maximize the sample overlap for MSA, as well as the parallel imaging will line up with the existing one.
