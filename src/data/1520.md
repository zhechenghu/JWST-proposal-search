## ABSTRACT

This calibration activity will routinely anneal the three MIRI detectors to remove detector artifacts and keep the detector arrays in a known and stable state. With our current knowledge of the behavior of the MIRI detectors, we estimate that a frequency of once-a-day anneals will be sufficient to ensure good detector performance during Cycle 1. The anneals will be performed during spacecraft slews and will use the optimum temperature set-point determined during commissioning activity CAR-MIRI-002.
This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This APT file contains observations which will anneal all three MIRI detectors.

**TIMING CONSTRAINTS:**
The anneal sequences should:
1) Occur every 24 hours on average, with intervals no shorter than 16 hours and no longer than 32 hours.
2) Be executed as slew parallels when the telescope is slewing to a non-MIRI target.
3) In the event of long observations, e.g. long TSO programs or deep fields, or multi-day periods when MIRI is not used, an anneal should be executed before the next MIRI observation, in the next available slew parallel slot to a non-MIRI target.
The timing constraints are set based on a launch date of 25 Dec 2021 and an assumed start of Cycle 1 on 1 Jul 2022.
Only observation 1 has been constrained. Remaining observations should be scheduled during non-MIRI slews as per the above constraints.
