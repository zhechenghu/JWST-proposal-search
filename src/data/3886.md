## ABSTRACT

Brown dwarfs (BDs) are faint, sub-stellar objects and are the link between stars and planets. Low-mass stars tend to have abundant terrestrial planets and the formation and evolution of BDs themselves may be a window into giant planet formation. In contrast to higher-mass disks, BD disks are optically thinner in the mid-infrared giving us access to the gas and dust composition closer to the disk midplane where planets are forming, making them unique objects to study. Spitzer-IRS spectra of BD disks showed generally weak silicate features indicative of dust settling and gas detections that point to a high carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. The high C/O ratio may be due to 1) oxygen locked up in ice in the outer disk, 2) a carbon-rich chemistry close to the midplane that is only observable in disks with settled dust, and/or 3) the destruction of carbonaceous grains. Any of these scenarios would have a profound impact on the composition of forming planets and JWST-MIRI MRS data are crucial for studying the gas and dust in the planet-forming zones, particularly in these faint targets. Cycle 1 observations are largely focused on higher-mass sources, leaving a need for observations of BDs. We propose to get high sensitivity (SNR>100) spectra for a large and representative sample of 15 low-mass targets to catalog the chemical inventory and study the connection between the gas and dust properties. These targets span a range of ages and, based on low-resolution IRS data, show diversity in silicate feature strength and shape, indicating large variations in the dust properties. We will be able to put these systems into context with higher-mass stars that are observed in larger numbers.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request MIRI MRS observations for 15 disks in five star-forming regions. The targets are: ISO-Oph 32, GY92 141, GY92 320, J16085953-3856275, SST-Lup3-1, ISO-Chal 138, J11095215–7639128, J11104141–7720480, J04242646+2649503, J04201611+2821325, J15555600–2045187, J15560104-2338081, J15591135–2338002, J16100541–1919362, and J16060391–2056443. For each observation we start with Target Acquisition to minimize fringe effects which can reduce the data quality. We aim for complete wavelength coverage and therefore use all three grating settings (Short, Medium, and Long). Our exposure times are determined such that we achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 100 or above in the 1C to 3C range (6.5 to 18 micron) where the main features needed for our science occur. We take simultaneous imaging in the F770W filter to maximize the output of the program without significantly increasing the overall time, except in the observations where simultaneous imaging will put the observations over the data excess threshold. We use a 4-point dither pattern for our unresolved sources.
