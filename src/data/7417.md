## ABSTRACT

Spectroscopic confirmation of the brightest, highest-redshift galaxies is needed to constrain galaxy formation models and the assembly of the first massive halos formed after the Big Bang. Here we propose to confirm 30 luminous (MUV < -21), robust candidate z~10-12 galaxies from wide-field JWST imaging. They are as bright or brighter than current record-holders like GN-z11, GL-z12 and GS-z14-0 (the only comparably bright, z>10 confirmed galaxies known) and are likely the most luminous JWST will ever find. Only NIRSpec can deliver spectroscopic confirmations at these redshifts, and only wide-area surveys like COSMOS-Web can select such luminous, rare targets. We design 16 efficient NIRSpec/PRISM MSA pointings across the field where we will observe 30 (of 50) extremely luminous candidates plus ~2700 fillers. Our goals are to precisely constrain the bright end of the UVLF at z~11; with precision volume densities boot-strapped to clustering measures that also use photometric redshifts, we can infer the halo masses of our primary targets and set limits on their stellar masses and efficiencies. Our PRISM spectra will also be sensitive to several rest-frame UV high-ionization lines (NIV, CIV, CIII], Ne IV) at equivalent widths sufficient to distinguish between AGN and star-forming drivers and detect continuum at high signal-to-noise. With a population of spectroscopically confirmed sources >10x larger than existing samples at these redshifts and luminosities, these observations will be transformative to our understanding of the brightest galaxies at cosmic dawn.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program consists of 16 NIRSpec MSA pointings focused on z>10 luminous galaxy candidates in the COSMOS-Web field. The MSA is configured to capture these candidates as well as 170 additional galaxies in the field per pointing in PRISM mode to obtain R~200 spectroscopy for ~2700 galaxies. We use the NRSIRS2RAPID readout pattern with 29 groups per integration and 1 integration per exposures x 3 dithers x 3 NIRCam filter switches. We use a 3 shutter slitlet nod pattern with no dither to optimize time spent integrating our spectra without incurring overheads for reconfiguring the MSA.
In parallel, we obtain NIRCam imaging in F115W, F115W, F150W SW filters and F356W, F410M, and F444W LW filters These filters will enable a transient search at z>3 at the highest redshifts and deepen imaging for non-transient science.
