## ABSTRACT

    This activity will improve our understanding of the MIRI LRS slit throughput as a function of wavelength and position in the slit by scanning a point source across the slit at the two nominal nod positions. These scans will be longer than similar observations executed in Commissioning, will check the point-spread function (PSF) far from its center, and improve our calibration for extended sources. The scans will also confirm the center of the slit, because the throughput from the target should be at a maximum when the telescope reports that it is pointing at the center of the slit in each scan.
    This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    The two observations each scan a standard star in the cross-dispersion direction across one of the nod positions.
