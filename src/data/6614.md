## ABSTRACT

The number of bad pixels is increasing monotonically with time. Standard anneals seem to reduce the number of bad pixels, but they always return within a matter of hours. Rather than continuously update the bad pixel maps for each detector on a rapid cadence, we will test whether hotter anneals fix any of these pixels, or at least correct them for an appreciable amount of time.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will obtain a pre-anneal dark with all three detectors to establish a baseline number of bad pixels. Then we will immediately perform an anneal at the maximum allowable temperature, followed by another set of darks 4 hours and 1 day later.

The maximum anneal temperature is 29K, which is a substantial increase over the standard anneal set-point of 26K relative to the ~6K operating temperature. If the anneal is deemed safe and there is a moderate improvement, it may be worth future investigations of anneals above the current upper limit.
