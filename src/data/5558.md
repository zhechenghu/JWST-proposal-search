## ABSTRACT
We propose a systematic improvement to the selection of active galactic nuclei (AGN) throughout cosmic time via rest-frame optical emission-line ratio diagnostics. We will (1) perform photoionization modeling to describe the evolution of the BPT, VO87, and OHNO diagrams using physically motivated scenarios, including alpha- or CNO-enhanced chemical abundances of stellar populations and AGN, (2) leverage publicly available spectroscopy of ~14,000, 0 < z < 10 galaxies from the JWST archive to test their evolution of BPT, VO87, and OHNO as a function of observable characteristics, and (3) combine these methodologies to formulate a comprehensive physics and chemistry informed redshift evolution of BPT, VO87, and OHNO. This work will provide a critical result to the community which is immediately applicable to all studies of high-redshift emission-line galaxies.
