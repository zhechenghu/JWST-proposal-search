## ABSTRACT

What role does merging play in driving the structural, star formation, and kinematic evolution of Milky-Way mass galaxies? Galaxy formation simulations predict that these impacts depend on numerous factors, particularly the stellar mass and time of the merger. Stellar halos contain debris from these mergers, and studies of the Milky Way and M31 show that measurements of these halos can reveal merger mass and time, linking merger history with galaxy features. Resolving stars in the halos of highly-inclined galaxies is key to measuring halo mass and merger time. Pilot studies using HST and from the ground have clarified the most useful observational strategies and aided in the development of interpretive tools, but the samples are too small to distinguish between the wildly different predictions of modern cosmological simulations. We propose a NIRCam F115W/F277W resolved-star survey of the stellar halos in a sample of 28 highly-inclined Milky Way-mass galaxies, with distances of 9-20 Mpc. With the power of JWST, we will target the minor axes of these galaxies, and use the tested method of individual resolved RGB stars to measure stellar halo masses and average metallicities, determine precise TRGB distances (22 new distances, including 5 SNIa hosts), and estimate the dominant merger time by combining with resolved age-sensitive bright AGB stars. When combined with existing measurements for nearby galaxies, this survey will measure stellar halo properties and merger histories for a diverse, volume-limited, and representative galaxy sample to 20 Mpc; a sample with the statistical power to reliably assess the role of merger history in galaxy evolution for the first time.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program targets 28 nearby galaxies from 9â€“20 Mpc with NIRCam, in the F115W (SW) and F277W (LW) filters. For half of the sample (14/28) at distances <15 Mpc, we target two pointings with NIRCam along the minor axis of each galaxy; for the other half at distances >/= 15 Mpc, we target a single pointing.
Each observation is composed of 4 standard subpixel NIRCam only dithers, using the INTRAMODULEBOX pattern, which sufficiently covers the detector gaps in each array, provides excellent PSF sampling, and results in robust cosmic ray rejection. As we do not require continuous spatial coverage for our science goals, far preferring depth uniformity in each field, we do not attempt to cover the module gap. Given the target photometric depth set by the RGB and AGB stellar evolutionary phases and the range of distances, the exposure time requirements for our observations vary. Depending on the requirement, we adopt a SHALLOW4 (nearby), MEDIUM8 (intermediate distance), or DEEP8 (distant) readout pattern. These were chosen to satisfy our exposure requirements and also to allow higher frame averaging, protecting against cosmic ray hits (per the JWST User Documentation). Total expsoure times for each observation range from 1030.73s to 10650.88s.
We impose four special requirements: (1) a relatively tight range in PA for each galaxy, to ensure placement along their minor axes, (2) the condition that both observations for the targets with two pointings must be taken at the same PA, (3) organization of targets' with dual pointings into non-interruptible sequences, to prevent an additional slew overhead, and (4) offsets to precisely position the target fields along the minor axis of each galaxy, at specific physical scales (i.e. ~10 kpc inner, 40 kpc outer) away from the galaxy center. We note that the offsets do not affect program overheads or the scheduling window.
We also request coordinated parallel NIRISS imaging for each observation, in the F115W filter. For the NIRISS imaging, we adopt an NIS readout pattern. To keep exposure times within, but close to, the NIRCam exposures, we adopt either 1 integration/exposure for NIRCam exposures <~5000s, or 2 integrations/exposure for NIRCam exposures >~5000s.
