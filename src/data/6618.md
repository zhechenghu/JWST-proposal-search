## ABSTRACT

This activity will test the ground-based filter transmission functions by observing a red object through all nine MIRI imaging filters. The target will be a main-belt asteroid which will also be observed with the MRS to provide a spectrum covering the full 5-28 um wavelength range. Comparing synthetic photometry of the asteroid using the MRS spectrum of the asteroid with the actual photometry with the imager will test the filter functions and check for any possible filter leaks of red or blue light. Similar analysis on standard stars, comparing actual photometry and synthetic photometry with both model spectra and MRS spectra, will provide further tests.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This CAL activity observes a moving target in the Solar System in both the MRS and the imager.

The target chosen, (75482) 1999 X173, has an extremely slow rotation period (estimated 1234 +/- 90 hours), which makes it useful as an absolute calibrator.
