## ABSTRACT

We will obtain infrared spectra of seven evolved objects in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds that exhibit spectral features from complex hydrocarbons using both the Fixed Slit on NIRSpec and the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) on MIRI. These sources have departed from the asymptotic giant branch and are evolving into planetary nebulae. They display a range of carbon-rich spectral characteristics, including the classic spectrum attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons seen in many planetary nebulae, mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, the still-unidentified 21 um emission feature, and recently discovered but still unidentified emission features apparently associated with hydrocarbons. This project will exploit the unprecedented combination of spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, and sensitivity offered by NIRSpec and the MRS to explore the chemistry of complex hydrocarbons as carbon stars evolve into planetary nebulae. The resulting spectra will sample the gas and dust at different stages of evolution as carbon-rich objects seed their host galaxies with fresh dust.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Observations of each target include spectra with the NIRSpec 0.2" Fixed Slit with the G395H grating and the F290LP filter and the MRS on MIRI in all three grating settings. NIRSpec observations use a self-TA (WATA) and a three-point dither pattern. MRS observations are all self-TA and use a 4-point dither pattern.
