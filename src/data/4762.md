## ABSTRACT

A remarkable outcome from JWST is the high abundance of low-mass BHs, such represented by red point sources, so-called red dots. However, the limited survey volume of JWST is still sensitive to the abundant ``faint" populations, where most represent less active accretion. Here we propose in-depth JWST observations for the first, best candidate of the rapid growing young quasar embedded in a dusty starburst host (SFR=1,600 Msun/yr) at z=7.2, GNz7q, discovered with moderate UV luminosity as a quasar (Muv= -23) but still >10-100x brighter than those recent red dots. The latest NIRCam grism observations detect the broad Balmer line feature, suggesting a super-Eddington accretion (Eddington ratio~16) taking place in a low-mass black hole (logMBH~6.9 Msun), while the interpretation is still inconclusive with the current S/N. Interestingly, the recent JWST and NOEMA observations also unveil the area around GNz7q highly overdense (delta>=5-100) harboring unique systems such as multiple red dots, a merging galaxy, and dusty starbursts, with possible filamentary structures. We request NIRSpec, MIRI, and NIRCam F410M grism observations to 1) confirm the low MBH and uniquely high accretion, 2) look for signatures of significant outflows and a young quasar age, 3) spectroscopically and spatially separate the quasar and host to get independent measures of SFR and Mstar of the host, 4) quantify their co-evolution stage via MBH/Mstar, and 5) comprehensively map out surrounding objects to examine the overdense/filamentary structure. Our program will achieve the first comprehensive characterizations of the rapid growing system in the early universe from BH, host, to its environment.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This is NIRSpec G140M/F100LP, G395M/F290LP, NIRCam/F410M grism spectroscopy, and MIRI F1280W imaging & LRS and MRS spectroscopic observations for the super-Eddington accretion BH candidate GNz7q at z=7.2, its host, and surrounding galaxies. We will detect
For GNz7q & its host:
- G140M/F100LP: Lya (+Halo), Si IV, CIV, CIII]
- G395M/F290LP: H-beta, [OIII]
- LRS: H-alpha, Pa-beta
- MRS: Pa-alpha
- F1280W: (quasar)+stellar continuum
For z~7.2 galaxies surrounding GNz7q.
- F410M grism: OIII+Hbeta
in order to
(i) obtain M_BH and lambda_Edd via the most robust tracer Hbeta,
(ii) verify signatures of strong outflow and young quasar age,
(iii) spectroscopically and spatially separate quasar and host components and carefully evaluate star-formation SFR and stellar mass M_star of the host,
(iv) obtain M_BH/M_star, and
(v) fully map out the surrounding galaxies around GNz7q at the same redshift
