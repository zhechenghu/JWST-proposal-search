## ABSTRACT

We request bi-monthly observations of the LMC astrometric field for monitoring of the NIRISS photometric stability and as a quick check on the astrometric stability of the instrument. This is a continuation of cycle 1 calibation program 1515, cycle 2 program 4475, and cycle 3 program 6655. This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.
