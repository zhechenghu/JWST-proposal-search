## ABSTRACT

Planets form within disks of dust, gas, and ice around young stars. While our view of protoplanetary disk dust and gas has improved tremendously in recent years, we still have only a rudimentary understanding of the ice reservoirs in disks. The diversity of exoplanets and exocomets that may form around other stars depends crucially on whether disk ice compositions are similar or different in different systems. This can only be answered definitively with a deep near/mid-IR survey of edge-on protoplanetary disks, which is the aim of this proposal.

We will assess the diversity in ice compositions across different planet-forming systems by observing an unprecedented sample of 6 edge-on disks around low-mass stars. Spectral coverage from 1.7-28um with NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS will provide comprehensive ice inventories and simultaneous access to inner-disk gas compositions. We will obtain the deepest 3-5 micron spectra of edge-on disks to date, enabling detailed modeling of the ice band profiles. This is critical to accurately retrieving the disk ice abundances and compositions. Ultimately, this program will provide much-needed constraints on disk volatile budgets, ice-phase C/O ratios, and the compositions of icy planet-forming solids, with broad relevance to the planet formation, exoplanet, and solar system communities.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

NIRSpec IFU: The G235H and G395H settings are needed to cover all key ice bands in the near-IR, with high spectral resolution (R~2700) required to carry out line profile analysis and to separate out narrow gas-phase emission lines. A cycling 6-point dither will ensure sufficient sampling of the PSF, and facilitate bad pixel rejection. Dedicated background observations are not required. 5 of our diks targets fit within the NIRSpec FOV, but the Flying Saucer requires a 2-tile mosaic to cover the entire disk major axis. The G235H integration time is chosen to obtain a spatially binned SNR of 100 at 2.7 micron, as needed to detect the dangling OH band. The G395H integration time is chosen to obtain a spatially binned SNR of 150 at 4.7 micron, as needed to detect the CO line wings indicative of ice mixing.

MIRI MRS: the short, medium, and long sub-bands are required to cover all mid-IR line targets, including the CO2 bending mode at 15.2 micron, H2O bending at 6 micron, minor ice features from 7-9 micron, and gas-phase emission features across the entire mid-IR. The medium resolution (R~2000-4000 in channels 1-3) will spectrally resolve the ice bands and minimize blending between gas lines. A 4-point dither will be used to sample the PSF. Simultaneous imaging will be included for astrometry. Sky backgrounds were selected to avoid bright sources in 2MASS and WISE images, and will be observed with the 2-point dither pattern for backgrounds. The integration time is chosen to achieve an SNR of 50-70 across Channels 1-3 (5-18um) in order to characterize the 15 micron CO2 line profile and detect weak gas-phase emission lines.
