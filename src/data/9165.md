## ABSTRACT

Over the past two years, several independent studies have reported an astonishingly high number of bright z>10 galaxy candidates identified from deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. A growing collection of NIRSpec confirmations have solidified the picture that bright z~12-14 galaxies are >10 times more abundant than predicted by nearly every pre-JWST model. While relatively exotic solutions have been proposed to resolve this tension, new JWST data at slightly lower redshifts is hinting at a simpler explanation. Galaxies at z~6-8 are found to be experiencing much more bursty star formation histories (SFHs) relative to their lower-redshift counterparts, and these strong bursts make low-mass galaxies temporarily appear much brighter due to the sudden formation of many O stars. Several models have now demonstrated that a strong evolution in burstiness at z>10 can explain the high abundance of z=10-14 systems. Here, we propose to quantify the evolution in burstiness at z>10 by completing MIRI follow-up of the eight brightest spec-confirmed z=10-14 galaxies. Past work at z~0-8 have demonstrated that the optical [OIII] and H-alpha equivalent widths (EWs) and the Halpha-to-UV luminosity ratio (LHa/Luv) are excellent tracers of galaxy burstiness. With our proposed data, we will measure the median EWs and LHa/Luv of bright z=10-14 systems and compare to published findings at z~6-8. If we find that all of these properties increase substantially at z>10, it would firmly imply that very strong bursts of star formation are a key contributor to the stunning abundance of z>10 systems. Our data will also enable tests of other proposed explanations for the high z>10 galaxy counts measured with JWST.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We design our observations following successfully-executed and approved past programs (e.g., GO 3703, GO 4586). From the MIRI LRS observations, we aim to detect the optical [OIII] doublet and H-alpha lines at 5-sigma under the conservative assumption of no evolution in burstiness (EWs) from z~6-8. These LRS observations deliver simultenous measurements of the [OIII] and Halpha lines, and do not resolve the [OIII] doublet, thereby delivering the higher SNR over MRS (at fixed exposure time). We adopt ALONG SLIT NOD dithering with the FASTR1 readout pattern for LRS, splitting the total requisite exposure time into multiple visits where appropriate. Following GO 3703, we include target acquisition (TA) observations to prevent slit losses from off-nominal source placements.
We also conduct MIRI F560W imaging to constraint the rest-optical continuum around the lines (necessary for EW measurements). The imaging depth is set to reach 5-sigma sensitivity assuming the F444W flux density and typical z~6-8 line EWs. We adopt a 6 or 12 point CYCLING dither pattern.
