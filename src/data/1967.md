## ABSTRACT

We propose NIRSpec Fixed-Slit + NIRCam broad-band observations of 12 of the lowest-luminosity quasars known at z=6 to obtain the first full census of the black holes and host galaxies of the earliest quasars. We will derive the well-calibrated Hbeta-based masses (M_BH) of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with NIRSpec's G395M grism, from which we characterize the distribution functions of M_BH and Eddington ratios, eliminating severe previous selection biases due to the limitation of ground-based NIR spectroscopy. We will measure their host stellar masses with NIRCam's F150W and F356W filters to calculate the SMBH-to-stellar mass ratios, from which we investigate the origin of the tight correlation between M_BH and host bulge mass observed in the present-day universe. Our sample size will allow us to stringently determine whether SMBHs have grown in parallel with their hosts (as suggested by recent ALMA observations), or if one evolves faster than the other. Our sample is the least biased of all high-z quasar samples, allowing us to derive a comprehensive picture of the SMBHs and their host galaxies within the first billion years of the universe.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program is a joint NIRSpec Fixed-Slit Spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging of 12 of the lowest-luminosity quasars known at z=6, beyond the sensitivity limits of ground-based near-infrared spectroscopy (y=23-24 AB mag). The NIRSpec observations with the G395M grism are designed to cover the redshifted Hbeta emission line at 3.44-3.60 micron and its underlying continua, from which robust virial masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will be measured with the single-epoch method. The NIRCam imaging with F150W and F356W filters straddling the 4000 Angstrom breaks will enable us to measure the stellar masses and stellar populations of the host galaxies, after carefully subtracting the PSF components in the broad-band images. The 2D PSF+galaxy decomposition will give us an estimate of the stellar light contamination to the observed continuum fluxes in the NIRSpec spectrum covering the same wavelength range. Thanks to the low luminosities of our sample, the black hole masses and stellar properties of the host galaxies will constrain the mass distribution function and the stellar-to-SMBH mass ratios of the z=6 quasars for the first time.
