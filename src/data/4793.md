## ABSTRACT

Gas-rich galaxy centers like our own Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) are extreme environments for star formation where many formation promoting or inhibiting forces acting locally or on larger scales compete. CMZs are compact (<1kpc in size) and subject to high extinction, blocking optical light and limiting our understanding of the detailed physical processes at play. Observations that pierce through dust and resolve individual star-forming sites within galaxy centers are scarce. We propose ~10pc (0.2”) resolution NIRCam emission line imaging of a representative, unbiased set of 16 nearby well-studied extragalactic CMZs to provide the first robust statistical assessment of CMZ star formation properties (age, mass, size, location etc.), compare to in progress ALMA ~0.25" mapping of their molecular gas giving cloud properties, and correlate these with global CMZ and galaxy properties to determine whether local processes (i.e. stellar feedback) or large-scale environment control their star formation activity and answer if the unexpected properties of our own CMZ are unusual or common. We will obtain continuum-subtracted maps of five NIR emission lines: Pa alpha, Br alpha, the [FeII] line at 1.64 micron, the H2 line at 2.12 micron, and the 3.3 micron PAH feature which together provide well-understood diagnostics to map the location, amount, and (relative) age of embedded sites of massive star formation. This comprehensive study will provide the urgently needed data to distinguish between theories for CMZ star formation that either argue for a highly time-variable evolution caused by local processes or a more steady-state evolution regulated by the large-scale environment.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will use Module B of the NIRCam instrument to image the gas-rich centers (CMZs) of 16 nearby spiral galaxies in five filter combinations, in order to detect and characterize their (embedded) star formation activity. Our immediate objective is to obtain continuum-subtracted images in five emission lines: two hydrogen recombination lines (Pa alpha and Br alpha), the [FeII] at 1.64 micron, molecular hydrogen (H2) at 2.12 micron, and the PAH feature at 3.3 micron. Taken together, these have strong diagnostic power for constraining the physical processes driving the star formation process.

Specifically, we use the following filter combinations in the short- and long-wavelength channel: (i) F187N with F405N(+F444W), (ii) F164N(+F150W2) with F335M, (iii) F212N with F360M, (iv) F150W with F444W, and (v) F200W with F277W. These combinations provide a sufficient number of 'off' filters to enable accurate continuum SED fitting and thus subtraction.

In order to achieve a roughly equal exposure depth across the field of view with improved PSF sampling and redundancy to correct for bad pixels and cosmic ray hits, we will use the INTRAMODULEBOX dither pattern with 4 primary and 2 subpixel positions (SMALL-GRID-DITHER). Given that our targets are brighter in the continuum filters, and may have a number of sources (e.g. a central AGN) that could saturate the detector, we use the BRIGHT2 readout pattern with 5 groups and one integration at each dither position, for a total of 859s on-source for the short wavelength broad-band filters. For the narrow-band filters which contain the faint line emission, we use the same setup with the SHALLOW4 readout pattern instead, for a total of 1632s on-source for the line containing short wavelength narrow-band filters. This results in sufficient signal-to-noise in the filters for all our targets for robust determination of high-quality line emission maps. We require one visit per galaxy.

As our targeted region of interest is smaller than the NIRCam Module B FoV, we require no restrictions on the orientation of the observations.

The resulting data rate over each observation is below the limit.
