## ABSTRACT

A reference star HD 41094 is observed with the 5-point subpixel dither: POS1 (nominally at pixel center), and 4 points in a half-pixel side square around the pixel center POS1. Each of the 5 subdither positions is exposed to a depth of 2E9 e-. The primary data analysis method planned is amiGO+dLux software, which recovers several detector, electronics, and optics calibration quantities using a Bayesian joint estimation of the sky scene (assumed to be a point source) and modelled calibration quantities. Raw pixel data is analysed diectly in this approach. The data can also be analysed using the JWST AMI pipeline, to improve e.g. charge migration treatment by the Detector 1 pipeline step, and to improve other steps (e.g., 1/f noise identification).

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

One visit to the target executing A 5-point subpixel dither around POS1 in each of the filters should be perfoprmed with no interruptions. Peak pixzels are to be ~5e4 electrons, and the total depth ~2e9 electrons at each dither. One successful target acquisition is needed.
