## ABSTRACT

M-type dwarfs are the largest constituent of the Universe and the most likely host star of the nearest exoplanetary system. Disks around main-sequence stars are very important environments as the initial condition of planet formation and the blueprint of an underlying planet's dynamical evolution. Therefore, disks around M-dwarfs can inform us of the most important planet formation/evolution environment around the most ubiquitous exoplanetary systems. Unlike their more massive main-sequence counterparts, discovered debris disks around M-dwarfs, hereafter M-dwarf disks, are extremely rare. The paucity of M-dwarf disks has been interpreted either as non-existence or non-detection. The non-existence scenario ties closely to the fundamentally different dust grain dynamics around M-dwarfs where the stellar wind plays a main role in grain removal mechanisms (drag or blow out), replacing the role of radiation around more massive stars. Recently, from the cross-correlation of Gaia DR2 dwarfs against sources in the AllWISE catalog, 49 late-K and M-dwarf disks (37 new) have been discovered. We propose to obtain MIRI/LRS spectra covering the wavelength range of 5-15 micron of 20 brightest M-dwarf disks from this list. With LRS spectra, we will (1) assess the existence of solid state emission features, (2) evaluate the potential different evloutionary pathways of dust grains around M-dwarfs, and (3) better constrain disk parameters [T_disk and fractional IR luminosity] of the statistically significant sample of M-dwarf disks.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This program aims to obtain LRS spectra of 20 targets (late K- and M-dwarf disk stars) covering the wavelength range of 5-15 micron. All our targets have mid-IR brightnesses above 5 mJy at around 10 micron. Detector setup of Ngroup =30, Ninteg=1, FASTR1 readout with the standard dithering along the LRS slit should produce high (>10) S/N spectra for all our targets. Target Acquisition verification images with F1000W will be obtained and SLIT_TA images can be used in the absolute flux calibration of the obtained LRS spectra.
