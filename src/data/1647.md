## ABSTRACT

A polluted white dwarf hosting a planetary debris disc is experiencing an infrared outburst on a scale unprecedented in decades of observations. Recent follow-up photometry confirms the system remains highly active, and we propose multi-wavelength monitoring across a range of timescales to follow this event as it unfolds.

There is compelling evidence that planetary systems survive through stellar evolution and emerge dynamically active around white dwarfs. WD0145+234 is a rare example where emission from circumstellar gas and dust accompanies the photospheric metals. It recently brightened by over one magnitude in the infrared, likely due to emission from dust liberated in planetesimal collisions. Catching it in such an active state gives us a ringside view of white dwarf debris disc evolution in real time.

As one of the brightest representatives of its class, the system is ripe for mineralogical characterisation, and the collisional activity makes a strong case for a search for variation. If optical studies show changes in the photospheric metals, they would be the first of their kind, so taking infrared spectra in parallel is the best way to maximise the science return.

Timely infrared observations are critical to understanding the nature of this spectacular event. Our program will investigate the composition, dynamics, and evolution of this evolved planetary system, and the insights gained will be applicable across the population.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

(1) Photometric monitoring, using NIRSpec in BOTS mode with the prism to obtain hour-long light curves, which themselves will be used to build up a long-term light curve.

(2) MIRI MRS spectroscopy to characterise the system. Wavelengths up to 13 microns are targeted at S/N > 20, based on a conservative estimate of the dust brightness. Longer wavelength data will be binned in the spectral direction to measure the continuum and any broad features.

Six epochs of photometry are required, the first and last of which will also take MIRI spectra. Observation groups are set up so that visits occur on an approximately logarithmically-spaced cadence, and so that MIRI spectra are taken as close as possible to the photometry.
