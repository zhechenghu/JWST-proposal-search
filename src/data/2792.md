## ABSTRACT

"We propose NIRSpec and NIRCam observations for an extremely luminous galaxy, XMM3-3085 at z=10.2 with Muv=-23.7 mag, whose high redshift is suggested by recent HST grism spectroscopy. XMM3-3085 is the most luminous galaxy at z>10, and such a luminous system is not expected theoretically, indicating an unusually vigorous period of early star formation with high efficiency, the existence of AGN activity, or stellar populations characterized by a top-heavy initial mass function possibly with Pop-III stars. Thanks to its bright nature, a quick 1 hour NIRSpec/PRISM observation will allow us to confirm the HST-based redshift efficiently, and moreover, detect various emission lines including OIII]1665, CIII]1908, [OII]3727, [NeIII]3869, Hdelta, Hgamma, and [OIII]4363. Combined with NIRCam observations tracing the continuum redder than the Balmer break, we will measure the physical parameters including the [OIII]4363-based matallicity for the first time at z>10, to understand early stellar mass assembly and dust and metal enrichment, and will discuss the physical nature of this remarkably luminous galaxy, whose existence is a challenge for current galaxy formation models."

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

"We will conduct NIRSpec spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging for a remarkably luminous galaxy at z=10.2, XMM3-3085.
We choose NIRSpec/PRISM CLEAR with the 0.4" fixed slit to efficiently detect various emission lines and Lyman-alpha break. Since our targets are bright (23.9), we will use WATA with CLEAR, NRSRAPIDD6, and FULL subarray.
We conduct NIRCam F200W+F480M imaging to estimate a robust stellar mass."
