## ABSTRACT

    The number of bad pixels on the MIRI detectors is growing with time. We require a series of trending darks to continue to monitor this growth and create new reference files. These darks also serve the purpose of continuing to give the same value to the study of persistence as they did in Cycles 2 and 3. The additional data might also prove useful for a synthetic correction of the dark rate in the future.

    This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    We will continue the same trending darks as obtained in Cycles 2 and 3. They will be taken with the same exposure parameters, but with a longer cadence in-between, to cover the entire cycle.
