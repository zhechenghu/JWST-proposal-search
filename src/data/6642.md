## ABSTRACT
We will obtain MOS observations of a planetary nebula in M31 in order to check the wavelength calibration as a function of MSA field position. These data will allow us to more firmly tie the calibration of the prism to the gratings, and characterize any residual field dependence not already accounted for by the instrument model. The M31 target is expected to be spatially unresolved, and of suitable brightness to allow efficient and unsaturated exposures with all dispersers.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.
This program includes MOS observations at 4 field positions with all dispersers, and an additional 4 positions with the prism. NIRCam pre-imaging will be obtained first in order to prepare a sample of reference stars for MSATA, and verify the brightness and spatial extent of the target. We will then obtain an intermediate prism observation with one of the fixed slits to further verify emission line strengths, with sufficient lead time to allow any necessary modifications to the MOS exposures.
