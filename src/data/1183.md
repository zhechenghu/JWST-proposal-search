## ABSTRACT

Following the epoch of planetary system formation (1-10 Myr), the bodies that were not aggregated by the larger planets remain in orbit around the central star and undergo a long timescale collisional cascade. The systems are void of gas by this time and the collisional processing provides a continuous source of micron size dust particles. These disks of particles, ranging in size from microns to kilometers, are called debris disks. Models of the collisional processing of materials provides us with estimates of the dust size distributions and our understanding of the various forces acting on them (gravitational and radiative) predict their physical locations. Furthermore, debris disks are also ideal astrophysical laboratories, providing us ways to study the material composition of the solid materials in planetary systems around nearby stars, as the fine dust detected in scattered light are produced from the collisional grinding of the largest bodies.

The Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide us images of nearby debris disks at HST-like resolution at near-infrared wavelengths, with great sensitivity. The technological advancements enable us to study the composition of the solid particles dust in these systems. Multi-wavelength scattered light imaging will reveal the water-ice, carbon-dioxide ice and tholin composition of the dust. While water is necessary for life to emerge in other worlds, tholins have been shown to be common in the outer regions of the solar system. Assessing the similarities and dissimmilarities of materials between these systems and our solar system will help place our own world into context.

Within our program, we will observe the following previously well studied (at other wavelengths) systems: HD 181327, HD 107146, HD 10647, HD 61005, and HD 32297.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will obtain NIRCam PSF-template subtracted coronagraphic images of the debris disks of HD 181327, HD 107146, HD 10647, HD 32297, and HD 61005. We observe all of our targets with the same filter set using the same sequence of observations, only varying the number of integrations/groups on each source and the readout modes, which depend on the predicted surface brightness of the disks and coronagraphic residual stellar light. To cover the spectral absorption lines of the systems, we will use the F335M and F444W filters in Cycle 1. For each target, we also observe a nearby and color- and flux-matched PSF reference source, using contemporaneous and identically executed observation sequences. While exact color-matching is not necessary for the longer wavelength observations, it may be relevant up to 3 microns.

Each set of observations is as follows: 1) We observe each target at two orientations, offset by 10 deg. At each orientation, we sequence through the filter set taking a total of 1200 to 1800 s of data per orientation. 2) We then observe the PSF refence at an undefined position angle, at both filters, for around 2100 s per filter, employing a 5 point dither pattern.

We join our NIRCam program with the NIRSpec program of Christine Chen (a contact Co-I on the proposal) on the source HD 32297. The basic NIRCam program, taking images at 2 wavelength bands for 5 sources, totals 28.83 hours, while the standalone NIRSpec program would be 3.00 hours. Our joined program is 31.33 hours, instead of 53.34, thereby saving 0.5 hours for the two programs, which we divide up evenly between the GTO programs.
