## ABSTRACT

An efficient coupling between the energy released by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxy can generate kpc scales outflows which may regulate the rate at which stars can form and ultimately influence the growth of the galaxy. These AGN-driven outflows include gas in various phases (ionized, atomic, molecular) but at z>1, due to the limitations of current instrumentation, we are forced to adopt a single-phase (ionized) view of the outflow phenomenon which may lead to wrong estimates of their extent, mass and energetics, therefore ultimately misinterpreting their relevance for galaxy evolution.

The aim of the proposed JWST/MIRI observations is to overcome this limit, and to map the mid-infrared ro-vibrational H2 lines to complete the multi-phase characterization of already well-studied AGN at cosmic noon. The three selected AGN have the best available characterization of the ionized component of the outflow at these redshifts, from sub-pc to kpc scales. With the MIRI observations we will be able to map the warm component of the ISM down to ~2 kpc. We will be able to test model predictions on the enhancement of H2 emission in the presence of cooling of gas shocked by AGN-driven outflow. Ultimately, we will derive the total (ionized+molecular) mass outflow rate and kinetic energy for these outflows which will provide a key constrain on the current models of AGN feedback.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The targets of these observations are three AGN at z~2 with well established ionized outflows from sub-pc to kpc scales.
We will use MIRI MRS to sample the warm molecular phase of the outflow via H2 transitions with the Long configuration in CH-1
We will also cover the PAH3.3 micron feature in the Long configuration in CH-2
We will not perform Target Acquisition, since the absolute JWST pointing accuracy of 0.1 arcsec is more than sufficient given the size of our targets (~1 arcsec diameter) and the fov of CH-1.
