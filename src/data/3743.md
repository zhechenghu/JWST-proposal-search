## ABSTRACT

The most rapidly star-forming galaxies in the early universe are ubiquitously obscured by dust. Over the last decade, consensus emerged that nearly all such dusty starburts were the result of gas-rich major mergers that triggered the intense star formation and rapid dust production. Recent ALMA observations have challenged this view, finding kinematics consistent with secular rotation-dominated kinematics in the cold atomic gas. These controversial findings have drawn scrutiny from both observational and theoretical perspectives, with explanations ranging from mismatched comparisons with lower-redshift galaxies to unexpected consequences of cosmological gas accretion. We propose to address this controversy head-on, using NIRSpec IFU observations of H-alpha in five z~4-5 galaxies with existing high-resolution ALMA CII 158um data supplemented by inexpensive imaging to map the stellar light. Our observations will give an independent constraint on the galaxy kinematics using a different gas tracer that also avoids the complexities of interferometric ALMA data. We will make the first direct comparisons of the level of turbulent support between the warm ionized and cold neutral gas phases in individual galaxies at z>4, pushing the frontier of large 1<z<3 ground-based samples to the first ~1Gyr after the Big Bang. Together, the combination of deep, high-resolution JWST IFU and imaging data and ALMA CII and dust observations will settle recent controversies in the starburst galaxy kinematics and enable a novel multi-wavelength view of the stars, warm and cold gas, and dust in rapidly-assembling high-redshift galaxies.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We are proposing for 5 targets at z>4 to study ionized gas kinematics at high redshift.

All 5 targets will use NIRSpec IFU with Grating/Filter: G395H/290LP, Readout: NRSIRS2, 4-8 cycling dither points.
Tot. exp. time 9ks-15ks depending on expected H-alpha flux. [Aimed at spectrally and spatially resolved detection of H-alpha]
A single exposure of MSA leak cal is proposed similar to the GTO teams' proposal to find any bright sources near stuck open MSA shutters.
Dedicated background exposures are not proposed as continuum measurement in NIRSpec is not the main goal of the proposal. None of the observations are background limited.

NIRCam Imaging is proposed with 3 filters to help partially constrain stellar mass. We will use only module B
with 4 primary dithers (INTRASCA).
Filters: F200W+F356W, Readout: BRIGHT2
Filters: F200W+F444W, Readout: RAPID
Exposure times are decided to detect the lensed source at LW with SNR greater than 5

MIRI Imaging with 3 filters (F560W, F770W, F1000W) is further proposed to constrain stellar masss up to 0.2 dex. 4 point dither cycling optimized for extended source will be used.
