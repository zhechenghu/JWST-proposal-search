## ABSTRACT

We propose a 4-tile NIRSpec IFU mosaic of the SGASJ1226 system at z=2.92, a pair of interacting star-forming galaxies that is highly magnified thanks to gravitational lensing. Deep and high-resolution VLT/MUSE data revealed a Lyman Alpha halo associated with the clumpy and blue merging galaxies, suggesting the presence of large-scale winds and H I gas reservoirs in their close environment. We will map all the strong rest-frame optical lines on 100-500 pc scales and constrain the conditions that give rise to the extended Lyman-a emission. Using the detailed, resolved nebular emission lines ratios and constraints on the stellar populations, we will: (i) Connect the physical conditions of the star-forming ISM to the extended Lyman-a emission; (ii) Constrain Ly emission mechanisms; (iii) Search for the drivers of the large scale outflow. Combining the proposed JWST data with a wealth of ancillary datasets, including ALMA, MUSE, HST and early-release JWST, offers the unique opportunity to peer with unprecedented detail into the origins of Lyman-a halos.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose a 4x1 tile NIRSpec IFU mosaic covering SGASJ1226+21 at z=2.92, one of the best-studied and highly-lensed examples of a pair of merging LBGs bound to a Lyman Alpha Halo. Our observations are designed to measure and spatially resolve strong nebular emission lines from Hbeta to [N II] 6583 in the arc B. The proposed mosaic complements existing single pointing NIRspec IFU data that covers the other galaxy in the system.

The instrument is configured with the G235/F170LP grating/filter combination, yielding R~2700, enought to resolve the lines and reveal potential broad components with FWHM > 400 km/s.
