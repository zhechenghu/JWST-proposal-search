## ABSTRACT
    We plan to characterize the atmosphere of the substellar mass object WD 0806-661 B by spectroscopic and photometric observations. We will also look for new companions or members of the system.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
    Four observation types:
    1) NIRSpec IFU spectra also allow search for nearby companions.
    2) NIRCam image in four colors also looks for new members of the system. This image field is not centered on either the WD or BD, but instead is offset a bit from the WD in the direction of the BD, searching along the "ecliptic plane" of the sytem. However, the field also does include the WD itself to look for nearby companions to that object.
    3) MIRI LRS spectrum of WD
    4) MIRI imaging observations to cover the wavelength range beyond 12 microns, not accessible to LRS (F1280W, F1500W, F1800W, F2100W) . These observations will also allow searching for cold companions.
