## ABSTRACT

The Coma cluster is the nearest rich cluster in the universe and a key touchstone for the extragalactic distance scale. Precise extragalactic distances are at the heart of the “Hubble tension” controversy, the most important problem in cosmology today. To address this problem, we will image more than 100 fields centered on 39 of the largest elliptical galaxies in the Coma cluster. We will measure surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) for more than 40 galaxies (depending somewhat on the field orientations), calibrate the color dependence of SBF magnitudes, and study the galaxy and globular cluster population properties in Coma. The SBF distance scale zero point will be set by scheduled JWST observations of the tip of the red giant branch in local elliptical galaxies. The Coma cluster observations are required to establish the SBF calibration as a function of galaxy age and metallicity in rich clusters, where future JWST observations will yield distances out to several hundred Mpc. The resulting calibration will enable an independent, high-precision determination of the cosmological distance scale in the local universe using a technique with precision comparable to that of Type Ia supernovae, but requiring only a single observation per measurement. The ability to measure precision distances efficiently will be an important step towards the ultimate goal of measuring H0 to 1% and resolving the Hubble constant controversy.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The F150W observations of 39 target galaxies will be kept simple by observing in a single primary filter and not requiring a fixed orientation for the secondary fields. We have optimized the offsets for each target to place the galaxy in one of the two NIRCAM modules and to increase the likelihood of getting secondary targets for the expected PA range for the observing dates we are likely to be assigned. There are three observing windows available for these targets, and two of them have the same range in PA. We would be happy to provide a second set of observations optimized for the other observing window. The goal is to get the main target galaxy and as many nearby galaxies as possible by tweaking the pointing and without constraining the scheduling of the observations. Field orientations have been entered as a Special Requirement for display purposes only.
All the observations will use the same exposure time using the BRIGHT2 readout mode and 9 groups per integration to correct for cosmic rays. We will use both NIRCAM channels in FULL readout mode. We will collect 4 dither positions using the INTRAMODULEBOX offsets to fill the small detector gaps while maintaining a maximum area of the highest S/N. Sub-pixel dithering is not needed (and not desired) for the SBF measurements. We will collect F356W images in the NIRCAM long-wave channel for photometry and calibration purposes.
We will collect parallel F150W NIRISS fields for as many of the targets as possible, at whatever position angle they happen to be, so we can augment the number of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies imaged. This will add value to the resulting dataset when combined with existing ground-based optical color information.
