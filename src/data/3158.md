## ABSTRACT

Detailed 3D zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations predicted a wide range of possible effects that energetic AGN-driven outflows have on their galaxy host's gas content: from no impact on to significant destruction of dense gas clouds in the nucleus and rapid suppression of star-formation. Observations are therefore key to determine which theoretical scenario is correct; however, they have been severely limited, prior of the JWST era, by their inability to have a reliable tracer of recent (<10 Myr) star-formation in luminous (log(Lbol)=45-46 erg s-1) AGN at z~2.
With JWST/MIRI, we will overcome this limitation by using the PAH[6.2 micron] emission to reliably trace, in a spatially resolved fashion, the recent star-formation. We target four AGN at z~2 with already identified ~6kpc wide ionized outflows based on deep SINFONI-AO observations. We will combine the MIRI PAH maps with the already available ionized outflow maps, as traced by [OIII], and ALMA maps tracing star-formation on ~100 My timescales (from rest-frame FIR continuum observations). This unique set of observations will allow us to answer the following questions: 1) are these AGN outflows able to rapidly suppress star-formation? 2) are these AGN outflows driven by radiation pressure on dust or are thermally driven?

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The targets of these observations are four AGN at z~2 with well established ionized outflows on kpc scales. We will use MIRI MRS to sample the PAH6.2 micron feature with the Short configuration in CH-4. We will not perform Targer Acquisition, since the absolute JWST pointing accuracy of 0.1arcsec is more than sufficient given the size of our targets (~1 arcsec diameter) and the fov of Channel-4.
