## ABSTRACT

Observations will be made of the single star ETV 4227-658-1 in the SUB80 read-out in regular imaging and then with the NRM in the beam to measure the fractional througput of the mask for photometric calibration purposes. This measurement differs from the full frame measurement because there will be signal losses out of the small sub-array, hence the fractional throughput measured here will not be the same as measured with the full frame imaging.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Observations will be made of the single star TYC-4227-658-1, which is in the continuous viewing zone and which is of the proper brightness to be observed in the SUB80 read-out in regular imaging for the four AMI filters. A second observation of the source will be made with the NRM in the beam for the four filters. Comparison of these observations will provide the relative photometric correction factors between the acquisition images and the NRM observations for NIRISS science observations. This assumes that the aperture losses can be accurately calculated from PSF models.
