## ABSTRACT

The amount of dust outside of galaxies, inferred from reddening measurements of background quasars and galaxies by foreground galaxy halos, is comparable to that within galaxies, but the origin of this dust is uncertain. Numerical simulations suggest that galactic winds, driven by stellar or SMBH processes, are the primary source of the enriched circumgalactic medium (CGM), but the direct detection of dust in a galactic wind on the relevant CGM scale remains elusive. The recently discovered 100-kpc (>20 r_stellar) wind in Makani, a massive galaxy at z = 0.459, is an excellent target to test this idea. The cooler neutral-atomic and molecular gas phases in this wind coexist with the warm ionized gas out to distances of 20 kpc but apparently not beyond. This provides tantalizing evidence that we are witnessing, for the first time on CGM scale, the dissolution of the outflowing cool clouds into the warm ionized phase as predicted by theory. Our proposed MIRI/NIRCam multi-band imaging of the warm dust and molecular gas in Makani will fill the temperature gap between the warm ionized gas and cool molecular/neutral-atomic material and capture this critical phase transition. This program takes advantage of a remarkable coincidence between several key spectral features of Makani and the bandpasses of the MIRI/NIRCam filters. These data will allow us to (1) determine whether dust grains experience evolution as they travel to large distances from the host galaxy, (2) assess the impact of the dynamic CGM on the processing of the warm H_2 molecules in the wind, and (3) provide a holistic view of the dust-H_2 cycle in forming galaxy-CGM ecosystems which will inform future modeling.
