## ABSTRACT

Starbursts, their galactic winds, and the physical mechanisms regulating them, are key to understand the evolution of galaxies through cosmic time. We propose to use the unparalleled capabilities of JWST to perform imaging and spectroscopic observations of NGC253 and M82, the nearest archetypal examples of the starburst phenomenon and the hosts of notable starburst-driven multi-phase winds. We will obtain MIRI MRS spectroscopy of their cores and MIRI/NIRCam imaging of their multi-phase outflows. Infrared and millimeter/radio imaging have revealed the presence of super star clusters (SSCs) in both objects -- the engines of the starbursts -- the youngest of which are still in formation and highly obscured. MIRI MRS spectroscopy of these starburst regions is our best tool to study these SSCs, enabling determination of their physical conditions, stellar populations, and feedback on their surroundings. We will also obtain MIRI and NIRCam imaging to trace dust and shocks in the cool, mass-dominant component of the outflowing gas through PAHs bands and band-ratios and the [FeII] and H2 v=1-0 transitions. At the unprecedented spatial resolution enabled by JWST, these data will reveal the details of the massive stellar clusters, the physics of the launching mechanisms of the cool wind, and the evolution of the neutral and molecular material as it is entrained by the hot galactic wind. The comparison of NGC253 (a nuclear bar-driven starburst in a large spiral galaxy) with M82 (an interaction-driven starburst in a dwarf galaxy) will allow us to characterize and compare the physics of SSC formation and wind launching in two distinctly different starburst environments.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

For both galaxies we carry out 3 types of observations:

1) MRS spectroscopy covering the area of the starburst and nascent clusters as determined from mm-wave spectroscopy and IR observations, as well as the base of the molecular wind. This requires 4 pointings in NGC253 and 7 pointings in M82. We enable simultaneous MIRI imaging in the same filters as described below. IRAC 8 um images have been used to select background positions which avoid bright emission but are still close to the galaxies. MRS and MIRI imager observations are sequenced, sharing a single MIRI MRS+Imager background.

2) MIRI imaging in 1130W and 770W, with 560W as the "off PAH" filter for continuum subtraction. Full array observations are obtained along the outflow, in a 4x1 mosaic with PA constraints, as the most efficient way of covering the required area. The PA constraints are designed to allow a reasonably wide scheduling window (1 and 1.5 months, respectively). The central region corresponding to the starburst is imaged in a second observation with the SUB128 sub-array in the same filters, to avoid saturation problems on the starburst. The background observations for MIRI are obtained with the simultaneous imaging turned on during the MRS background. For this reason the MRS-MRS background, and MIRI imaging are sequenced.

3) NIRCam imaging in the F164N, F212N, and F335M ([FeII], H2 v=1-0, and 3.3 um PAH) with F140M, F250M, and F360M as "continuum" filters bracketing the observations and enabling continuum color corrections. Full array observations are obtained along the outflow, in a 4x1 mosaic with PA constraints, as the most efficient way of covering the required area. The PA constraints are designed to allow a reasonably wide scheduling window (1 and 1.5 months, respectively). The central region corresponding to the starburst is imaged in a second unconstrained observation with the SUB640 array and RAPID readout to avoid saturation problems. Care was taken to keep the data rate for the large mosaic within the guideline of 0.68 MB/s using a MEDIUM8 readout pattern. No background observation is needed for NIRCam.
