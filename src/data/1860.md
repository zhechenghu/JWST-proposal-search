## ABSTRACT

Supernovae (SNe) Type IIn are known for their bright mid-IR luminosities and large dust masses. Inferred masses of newly formed SN dust can inform our understanding of the origin of dust in the high redshift Universe, particularly at the Epoch of Reionization. Pre-existing dust offers an independent measurement of the circumstellar medium (CSM) and, therefore, the pre-SN mass-loss history of the Type IIn progenitors, which remain largely unknown. The origin and heating mechanism of the dust, however, remains mostly ambiguous since a majority of the Spitzer observations contain only 3.6/4.5 micron photometry, which is insufficient to identify multiple dust components, detect colder (<500 K) dust reservoirs, and measure the dust composition. Unlike most other SN subclasses, SNe IIn dust (both newly formed and pre-existing) tends to remain radiatively heated by ongoing CSM shock interaction for years post-explosion, so that it will be warm enough (>200 K) to be detected by JWST. Here we propose MIRI/MRS spectroscopy of five well-studied SNe IIn from the Spitzer era that span a range of epochs (5-40 years) to constrain the origin, mass, and heating mechanism of dust in these systems. Cycle 1 is critical for these observations given the growing gap in time since their most recent Spitzer detection. No other telescopes, including SOFIA and ALMA, can make measurements of such dust in other extragalactic SNe due to sensitivity. Given the relative brightness of SNe IIn, we can complete this sample in 12.36 hours (including overhead).

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

These observations will obtain MIRMI MRS spectroscopy of 5 nearby SNe Type IIn to characterize dust. Observations will include all 4 channels and all 3 wavelength ranges. A dedicated background offset is necessary for SN 2010jl.
