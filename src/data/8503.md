## ABSTRACT

This calibration program will improve our understanding of the MIRI LRS slit throughput as a function of wavelength and position by scanning a point source across the slit at the two nominal nod positions. The scans will repeat the same scans used in Cycles 1-3. The target is an active galactic nucleus (AGN), as in Cycle 3. The red spectrum will greatly improve on the signal/noise at long wavelengths from scans using a standard star. The data will also check the slit throughput far from the slit center and improve our calibration for extended sources.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This activity images the AGN WISE J040937 in the F770W filter and scans it across the LRS slit in the two nod positions. The two scans across the slit are linked as a non-interruptible sequence.
