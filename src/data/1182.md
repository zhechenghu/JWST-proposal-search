## ABSTRACT

Using NICER extinction mapping, we will characterize the structure of selected Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDC). Three well-studied IRDCs will be targeted: G0.253+0.016 (the Brick), G11.11-0.12 (the Snake), and IRDC 18223. Using the unprecedented infrared sensitivity of NIRCam, we will take deep observations using the F115W, F182M, F356W, and F444W filters. The expected background star density at these low-latitude fields should permit probing Av>50 with 3-arcsecond angular resolution.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Environments for Massive Star Formation: Extinction Mapping of Infrared Dark Clouds. Using the Near Infrared Color Excess Method, we will use the great sensitivity and angular resolution of NIRCam to use background star counts to measure the column densities of infrared dark clouds.
