## ABSTRACT

Interstellar dust grains vitally affect the cooling and heating of the ISM and molecule formation. Understanding grain composition and structure in distant galaxies is therefore crucial for understanding the cosmic star formation history. A robust understanding of dust in distant galaxies is also needed to accurately correct for dust extinction effects on background objects. Unfortunately, grain properties in distant galaxies are poorly constrained. We propose to measure grain composition and structure in dense molecular clouds in galaxies at z<1 with MIRI MRS spectroscopy of background quasars (including several gravitationally lensed quasars) whose UV/radio/sub-mm spectra show strong molecular absorption and strong reddening, indicating large amounts of dust. The proposed MRS spectra will target redshifted features of silicates (10, 18 micron), hydrocarbons (3.4 micron), PAHs (3.3-11.3 micron), and ices (e.g., CO, CO2, CH3OH). Our main science goals are to investigate: (1) the silicate mineralogy and grain structure; (2) how materials in grain cores (carbonaceous/silicate) and mantles (ices) correlate in dense ISM in these distant galaxies; (3) how dust and ice are spatially distributed within and around the galaxies, and (4) how dust properties are related to other galaxy properties. Additionally, our observations will cover gas-phase CO rovibrational features and provide constraints on the 12C/13C and 16O/18O isotopic ratios. Only JWST MIRI has the powerful combination of the wavelength coverage, high sensitivity, and high spectral resolution crucial for measuring the mid-IR features of interest in the distant galaxies.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will obtain MIRI MRS spectra spanning 4.9-27.9 microns for our targets. We will also obtain dedicated background observations for each field. Further details are provided in the technical justification in the pdf attachment.
