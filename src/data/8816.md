## ABSTRACT

We observe all NIRCam filters with either MIRI or NIRCam in parallel, which will provide intra-instrument relative alignment.
We use a 2x2 mosaic with a large overlap and no dithers in order to observe the different filters with a minimal change of guiding for each position.
Observation 1 on 47 Tuc aims at permorfing astrometry and photometry.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

EXPOSURE SETUP: We use readout patterns and groups/ints appropriate for a broad dynamic range of LMC stars, as demonstrated by Commissioning and Cycle 2-3 observations of the LMC Calibration field. We also observe the 47 Tuc cluster.
DITHERS: We include 9 INTRASCA 24" dithers for imaging and coronagraphy
FGS1 is in parallel for all observations
