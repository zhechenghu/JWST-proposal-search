## ABSTRACT

We will conduct an ambitious deep-field survey to study the formation and evolution of galaxies from z 12 to z 2. Our program combines NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data, alongside the deepest data from HST, Chandra, ALMA, and JVLA, to produce an unprecedented view of high-redshift galaxies. The program is a collaboration of the NIRSpec and NIRCam GTO teams, and it combines imaging and spectroscopy as well as full use of coordinated parallel observations to get the best out of all three instruments. Indeed, to pursue a detailed understanding of galaxy evolution, the combination of imaging and spectroscopy is critical. By bringing these data sets together on a single field, we will carry out systematic investigations far beyond the sum of the parts.

This survey will provide the rest-frame optical data of sufficient area, depth, and spectral resolutions to map galaxy population properties, including the joint distribution of stellar mass, luminosity, star formation rate, stellar ages, sizes, metallicity, nuclear activity, gas kinematics, and outflows, over a wide range of redshifts. Broadly speaking, spectroscopy (at R=100,1000, and 2700) provides precise and robust redshifts, measurement of the stellar continuum, and emission lines to z 10 and beyond. The emission lines allow us to diagnose the galaxies' star formation rate (SFR), metallicities, chemical abundances, the ISM dust-reddening, and the ISM excitation, including signatures of AGNs. Low-resolution spectroscopy (R=100) for the brighter objects can also diagnose the stellar populations (especially the stellar age distribution). High-resolution spectroscopy (R=2700) can diagnose internal galaxy kinematics and outflows.

The multi-wavelength NIRCam imaging will allow the detection, selection and characterization of galaxies to z=15 and perhaps beyond. It will determine colors, morphological structure, and color gradients, while supplying photometric redshifts, stellar mass, and star formation rate estimates along with measures of equivalent widths of the strongest emission lines. The depth reached is unparalleled and will lead to luminosity functions to substantially higher redshift and lower mass than can be done with HST. Deep MIRI imaging will enable a rest-frame infrared view of subset of our sample, testing the assumptions of our UV/optical modeling and revealing heavily obscured stellar populations and nuclear activity. Combination with external data from Chandra, JVLA, and ALMA will further explore nuclear activity and dusty star formation. We expect that this carefully constructed survey will provide a primary legacy dataset for many years to come.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This APT file for Program 1180 does not include all the observations for the GOODS-S program due to APT file size limitations. Programs 1286 and 1287 have scheduling links with this program because they are NIRSpec MSA follow-up of this NIRCam "pre-imaging" Program 1180. The scheduling requirement is that the first observations in 1286 and 1287 should be done at least 60 days after the last observation in Program 1180. Given that 1180 will now be split over cycle 1 and cycle 2 we may waive this requirement for some observations in program 1286.

Observations 7 to 12 perform half of a NIRCam Deep "pre-imaging" mosaic in the GOODS-S field with MIRI in parallel.

Observations 13 to 18 perform the other half of the NIRCam Deep "pre-imaging" mosaic in the GOODS-S field with MIRI in parallel.

Observations 19 to 24 perform half of the NIRCam Medium depth "pre-imaging" mosaic in the GOODS-S field with MIRI in parallel.

Observations 25 to 30 perform the other half of the NIRCam Medium depth "pre-imaging" mosaic in the GOODS-S field with NIRSpec MSA observations (Medium/HST) in parallel.

**Deep Pointing 1 & 2** (observations 7-12)
NIRCam GTO team deep observations of GOODS-S with MIRI in parallel.
Mosaic positions correct for V3PA=300. All positions need to be adjusted slightly for any other PA.

**Deep Pointing 3 & 4** (observations 13-18)
NIRCam GTO team deep observations of GOODS-S with MIRI in parallel.
Mosaic positions correct for V3PA=300. All positions need to be adjusted slightly for any other PA.

**NIRcam+MIRI Medium** (observations 19-24)
NIRCam GTO team medium depth observations of GOODS-S with MIRI in parallel.
Mosaic positions correct for V3PA=308.0.

**Medium/HST** (observations 25-30)
NIRCam GTO team observations of GOODS-S with NIRSpec in parallel.
Mosaic positions correct for assigned V3PA=308.0 (NIRSpec Aperture PA=86.5745697).
