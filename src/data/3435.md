## ABSTRACT

Characterizing the interplay between the interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation (SF) on small scales (<50pc) and connecting it to the global galaxy properties is crucial to understand galaxy evolution. A unique target for such a study is the iconic Whirlpool Galaxy M51: its almost face-on orientation, outstanding ancillary data, and rich variety of ISM environments is ideal to address fundamental questions about SF, gas, dust, and feedback. JWST will provide crucial missing information about the small-scale dusty ISM and embedded SF. We propose wide-field imaging of M51 in a thorough set of narrow-, medium-, and wide-band filters covering key ISM emission lines, dust features, and continuum. We also propose three spectral maps cutting across different regions of the spiral arm structure. This efficient 14-band imaging and spectroscopy program will create an indispensable dataset, ideally suited to 1) constrain the life cycle of star-forming regions; 2) quantify the dust production rate; 3) and characterize the evolution of small dust grains. We will also produce for the JWST community science-ready catalogs, photometric and spectroscopic mosaics, and extracted line maps in addition to optimized recipes and filter combinations for continuum removal in narrow-band filters. This comprehensive Treasury survey of M51 will be an invaluable resource for the entire extragalactic community.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe M51 with NIRCAM and MIRI imaging and NIRSpec and MIRI IFU mapping.
We will obtain imaging mosaics of the main disk of M51 using NIRCam and MIRI. We will also target 4- pointing (~3"x12") spectral "strips" for three regions toward spiral arms, with NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We will obtain simultaneous observations with the MIRI imager during the MIRI IFU observations.
The NIRCam mosaic will be executed for 8 filters in total: F164N, F212N, F140M, F182M, F210M, F300M, F360M, F430M. MIRI mosaics will utilize 6 filters (F1000W, F1130W, F1280W, F1500W, F1800W, F2100W).
We will use the the G140M, G235M, and G395M gratings for NIRSpec observations. For MIRI IFU observations we will use all 3 grating settings of MRS.
Read-out patterns will be BRIGHT2 (NIRCam), NRSIRSRAPID2 (NIRSpec), and FASTR1 (MIRI imaging), and SLOWR1 (MIRI MRS).
To assess leakage through the MSA slits we will obtain leakcals for every grating setting, position, and dither of the NIRSpec strips. Spectral offs will be obtained for the MIRI IFUs towards an off-galaxy position. Imaging offs for MIRI will be obtained with a single pointing towards the off-galaxy position.
