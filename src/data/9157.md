## ABSTRACT

Most known exoplanets orbit stars that will eventually evolve into white dwarfs. However, little is known about the fate of these post-main-sequence worlds. One of the few known white dwarf planets is WD 1856+534 b, which orbits at just 0.02 au from its host starâ”€close enough that it should have been engulfed during the star's transition of the main sequence. Two main dynamical pathways have been proposed to explain this: high-eccentricity migration and common envelope evolution. We propose observations to constrain WD 1856 b's dynamical history by searching for signatures of common envelope evolution in the planet's atmosphere. If it did undergo common envelope evolution, it will be the first known planet to have survived engulfment by its star. Regardless of its dynamical history, our program will also probe the atmospheric physics of one of the coldest known planets. These results will provide critical insight into the dynamics of post-main-sequence systems and the atmospheres of cold worlds.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

MIRI MRS (31 hours) and NIRSpec (1 hour) observations of WD 1856+534.
