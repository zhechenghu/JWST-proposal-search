## ABSTRACT

This activity will monitor the MIRI MRS response to a standard star from the list of absolute flux calibration stars and characterize the MRS responsivity at very low flux densities. The objective is to investigate the noise properties of the MRS while observing faint targets and ensure that the spectral response remains valid. The target is the star GSPC P330-E (G0 V, K=11.379), which will be observed once in Cycle 1 and once per year in the following years. The apparent noise in the spectrum and flux density of the star will be measured as a function of wavelength and compared to the predicted values.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Observe a faint standard star with the MRS to verify flux calibration accuracy in the noise-limited regime.

**TIMING CONSTRAINTS:**
This program should be executed before June 15, 2023.
Missed or failed observations should be made up as soon as possible.

**TARGETS:**
This APT file includes a backup target in the event that rescheduling outside the visibility of P330-E is necessary.
