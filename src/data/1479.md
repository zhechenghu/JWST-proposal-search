## ABSTRACT

This program will calibrate and characterize the long wavelength (LW) grism, including spectral calibration and the line-spread function (LSF) characterization. The wavelength solution will be determined by observing 1 JWST spectral calibration source. This will likely be a planetary nebula, since PNe have a weak continuum and a rich set of strong spectral lines. The PN should also be sufficiently compact (e.g., sources in M31) to enable the LSF to be measured. Wavelength calibrator SMP LMC 58 (K = 14.5 mag) can be observed with MEDIUM8 readout, 7 groups, and 3 exposures/dithers to achieve S/N up to 200 per wavelength in grism mode with both F322W2 and F444W. This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

These observations will be collected for both grisms in each module using observations designed with the Engineering Imaging Template. Grism exposures will be collected through the F322W2 and F444W filters, which together provide overlapping spectral coverage from 2.4-5 microns and cover the bandpasses for the other allowed filters (F277W and F356W). The F405N filter is used for direct images since it is closest to the non-dispersed wavelength at 3.95 microns.
