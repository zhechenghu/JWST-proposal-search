## ABSTRACT

The fundamental building blocks of galaxies, star-forming clumps, have long been observable at the tens of pc scale at cosmic noon, the epoch of most vigorous star formation, thanks to HST and the magnification of gravitational lensing. Before JWST, however, it was impossible to precisely constrain the basic properties of these tiny clumps: their ages, sizes, star formation rates (SFRs), dust content, metallicities (Z), and ionization parameters (logU). Now, spatially-resolved spectroscopy with the NIRSpec IFU is revolutionizing the study of clumps in distant galaxies. Its ability to detect continuum in single clumps provides unprecedented constraints on clump ages and masses when combined with NIRCam and archival HST imaging. Its medium resolution gratings detect important diagnostic emission lines on a clump-by-clump level, revealing SFRs, reddening, Z, and logU. Together, these pieces of information will unlock nearly the full story of clumps from formation to (possible) destruction, and in turn, reveal secrets of galaxy formation. How are galaxies assembled? How do clumpy structures form? How do bulges form? How do galaxy-wide scaling relations like the fundamental metallicity relation come to be? Did clumps ionize the universe? We have designed a survey of clump demographics in 8 lensed galaxies (6 new targets and 2 archival), covering nearly over 100 clumps down to at least the 50pc scale, to directly address these questions. Early release observations like those of SMACS0723 have provided tantalizing hints of the answers and demonstrated feasibility, but ultimately were not designed for that purpose. It is time for a survey that is.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose NIRCam Imaging, NIRSpec IFU Prism and medium-resolution grating spectroscopy for six bright gravitationally lensed galaxies and their constituent star forming clumps at z=2.4-3.6. Our sample to study populations of lensed star forming clumps includes these six systems + 2 archival lensed galaxies.

We request NIRCam imaging in 6 filters custom to each target, with SHALLOW4 readout, and a group-integration-exposure strategy based on SNR>10 in the bluest filters with a 4-point dither strategy (4-1-4). The dither patterns and readouts are standard, to cover the arcs, avoid the chip gaps, and cover the galaxy clusters that lens the arcs.

We request NIRSpec prism spectroscopy to achieve SNR>5 in the continuum (assuming a star forming galaxy SED) with a dedicated nod exposure for background subtraction (15-1-4 strategy of group-integration-exposures). We request NIRSpec G235M spectra to get SNR>5 in emission lines for all targets. We use a NRSIRS2 readout and a 4 point dither. The number of IFU pointings per target ranges from 1-2.
