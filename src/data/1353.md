## ABSTRACT

We will construct both transmission and emission spectra of this planet over the entire 0.6-14 micron wavelength range using three transit observations (when the planet passes in front of host star) and three eclipse observations (when planet passes behind host star). Both the transmission and emission spectra will be obtained using a combination of NIRISS SOSS, NIRSpec SLIT1600 G395H, and MIRI LRS Slitless modes.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

ETC workbook ID is 86655
Ephemeris from Southworth (2012, MNRAS, 426, 1338) and confirmed via recent Hubble+Spitzer observations.
Note that ephemeris for WASP-17b being pulled into ExoMAST is not reliable/correct.
