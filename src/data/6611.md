## ABSTRACT

The number of bad pixels on the MIRI detectors is growing with time. We require a series of trending darks to continue to monitor this growth and create new reference files. These darks also serve the purpose of continuing to give the same value to the persistence study as they did in Cycle 2. The additional data might also prove useful for a synthetic correction of the dark rate in the future.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will continue the same trending darks as obtained in Cycle 2. They will be taken with the same exposure parameters and with the same timing relative to each other. All observations are parallels.

**TIMING CONSTRAINTS**
The observations are constrained to be obtained in a six-day window every ten days, with 20 observations total.
This APT file will carry the trending darks through late January 2025.
