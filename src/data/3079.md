## ABSTRACT

Observations of high-redshift quasars hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with billion solar masses less than 1 Gyr after the Big Bang challenge our understanding of black hole growth. In the standard black hole growth picture these quasars need to accrete matter continuously at the Eddington limit over timescales comparable to the age of the universe at that time, i.e. ~1e9 years. However, recent estimates of the quasars' lifetimes based on the line-of-sight proximity effect suggest lifetimes several orders of magnitude shorter than expected. Such short lifetimes and the rapid concurrent SMBH growth can be explained by invoking either highly radiatively inefficient ``super-Eddington' accretion rates, or obscured, dust-enshrouded SMBH growth phases. In order to break this degeneracy, this proposal aims to spatially map the ionizing imprint of the quasars' emission on the surrounding circumgalactic gas, in order to provide a model-independent lifetime estimate perpendicular to our sightline to the quasar, based on the light travel time of the quasar's radiation. A comparison between these two quasar activity timescales will either confirm the short lifetimes and thus require ``super-Eddington” accretion rates to explain the rapid SMBH growth, or show a discrepancy, indicating evidence for time-variable obscuration effects along our line-of-sight. Either observational result will present novel insights into the early growth phases of SMBHs. The spatially resolved line diagnostics from the proposed NIRSpec/IFU observations will also allow us to distinguish between gas photoionized by the quasar or by the long sought-after stellar light of their host galaxy.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This proposal aims to observe the extended nebular emission around four quasars at z~6 with NIRSpec IFU. We chose the G395M/F290LP disperser/filter, which provides a continuous wavelength coverage of 2.87um-5.27um, covering the brightest nebular emission lines at the redshift of our targets, i.e. [OIII] at 5007A, Halpha at 6563A, [NII] at 6583A, as well as most of the fainter emission lines, such as Hbeta at 4861A, Hgamma at 4341A, [OIII] at 4959A, Hell at 4686A, [OI] at 6300A, [NII] at 6548A, and the [SiII] doublet at 6716A and 6731A.

The spatially resolved line diagnostics will allow us to distinguish between regions ionized by the quasars or by the stellar light of their host galaxies by means of the BPT diagram. The spectral resolution of R~1000 allows to resolve the kinematics of the surrounding gas, such as in- and outflows, which exceed velocities of a few spectral pixels, i.e. \Delta v>~1000 km/s.

The quasar will be located in the center of the NIRSpec FoV. No target acquisition is needed, as Gaia guide stars (GS) are available for any orientation, hence a 0.1" pointing accuracy is sufficient for our goals.

To ensure a greater than 10 sigma (greater than 5 sigma) detection of the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile of the [OIII] nebulae at R~0.5 arcsec (R~1 arcsec) distance from the quasar, we need to integrate for 3.3 hours on each target, which we split into 8 individual exposures of ~1500s (100 groups) each, in order to avoid saturating any pixels on the detector. This will allow observations with a surface brightness limit of ~2e-19 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2. We apply a small cyclic dither pattern with 8 dithers, such that any excess light from MSA leakage can be removed, as pixels affected by this excess light appear as outliers when dithering. We will use NRSIRS2RAPID for its improved noise performance, which is essential for our program.

In total we ask for 12.97 hours of science time for three targets, 19.64 hours when including overheads.
