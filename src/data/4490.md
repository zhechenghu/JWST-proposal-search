# 4490 - CAL-MIRI-232  LRS External Flatfield

## OBSERVATIONS TABLE
| Label          | Observing Template                | Science Target      |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Slit scan      | MIRI Low Resolution Spectroscopy  | (1) BD+60-1753      |
| Slitless scan  | MIRI Low Resolution Spectroscopy  | (2) HD-163466       |

## ABSTRACT

A star will be scanned along the slit and across the slitless subarray to obtain flatfield data for the MIRI LRS. These data will be combined with information obtained separately from internal flatfield measurements to build flatfields for the LRS. Scans with 1-pixel steps will be used for both the slitless subarray and the slit.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Two standard stars will be scanned in the cross-dispersion direction, along the full length of the LRS slit and across the full LRS slitless field. Both scans use 1-pixel steps. The observations are constrained to take place after 1 Jan 2024.
