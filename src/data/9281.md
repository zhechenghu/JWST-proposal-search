## ABSTRACT

This program provides internal lamp flat observations to be carried out during slews. These observations allow a direct comparison with ground-based data taken in the CV3 and OTIS testing to see whether the detector properties have changed. This continues programs 1503 from cycle 1, 4472 from cycle 2, and 6654 from cycle 3.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The internal lamp flats are primarily for tracing changes in the illuminated detector response that the darks do not track: in particular, dead pixels, low response pixels, and open pixels are detected in the lamp flats but are not detected in the full frame dark ramps. The program requests a lamp exposure during a slew every 6 months to track these types of pixels. The program is changed from previous cycles by having just one filter set-up for the lamp flats rather than several, and having a lower cadence.
