## ABSTRACT

This activity aims to collect a dataset that will be adequate to model the MIRI Last Frame Effect. The data will be used to study and create either an empirical correction, or failing that, a machine learning model. Such a dataset must include many samples, fully exploring the dynamic range of the detector and various levels of contrast. These data, paired with darks from Cycle 1 (CAL-MIRI-001, PID 1517 and 1519), will form an adequate data set.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This activity consists of two observations, which are constructed identically and are of different targets.
Each observation includes just one MRS grating setting with imaging in one filter in parallel.
The timing of the two observations is unconstrained.
