## ABSTRACT

Dusty starbursts in massive galaxies at redshifts z=2-4 (DSFGs) are the most vigorous sites of star formation known. What processes regulate and limit star formation at the highest rates? Rest-frame optical IFU spectroscopy has been very successful in probing outflows and star formation in main sequence galaxies, but failed to penetrate deep into the most extreme DSFGs at these redshifts. Through MIRI-MRS the bright NIR recombination and H2 lines are now observable at z=2-3, which are our best tracers of star formation and feedback in the nearby Universe, and also a new star-formation tracer, PAH3.3. With MIRI-IFU we will study 12 NIR lines in 3 of the brightest, gravitationally lensed galaxies on the sub-mm sky on scales of 200-300 pc. All have detailed lens models and wide sets of ancillary data including HST imaging and millimeter line and dust interferometry. We will obtain Pa-a, H2 1-0 S(3), [FeII]1.26, and Br-d, which will enable us to map the star formation rates, probe the presence of shocks from supernovae and gas accretion, and to compare their relative impact on the gas. The glow of warm H2 on the turbulent surfaces of molecular clouds has been observed in nearby starburst galaxies, but never in the early Universe, where it would demonstrate that turbulence, perhaps created by feedback or gas accretion, is indeed as widespread in these galaxies as often postulated. We will also search for blue wings of Pa-a and warm H2 that would probe outflowing gas, and be the first evidence of starburst-driven winds in these systems, and compare star-formation rate estimates from Pa-a and PAH3.3 to see whether the latter is a reliable star formation tracer.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe Pa-alpha, [FeII]1.26um, H2 1-0 S(3), Br-delta, and the 3.3-micron PAH feature in three bright, infrared selected, gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshifts z=2-3. NIR lines, that can now be observed with MIRI for the first time in these galaxies, are much more effective to probe the warm ionized and molecular gas in these galaxies than the optical, where extinctions are high, AV~4 and more. These five lines can be observed with two setups with MIRI, with the exception of J1127+4228, where [FeII] will be covered with a separate observation with NIRSPEC. We will observe at 200-300 mas resolution, the diffraction limit of the JWST in this wavelength regime, corresponding to scales of 200-300 pc.
