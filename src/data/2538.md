## ABSTRACT

Using the MIRI Four-Quadrant Phase Mask Coronagraph operating with the F1550C filter, we will directly image the massive planets that are responsible for sculpting the sharp inner edges of nearby debris disk systems that have been imaged with ALMA. We use semi-analytical models to derive a lower limit on the planet mass, as well as an outer estimate to the planet orbital separation. To estimate our sensitivity to planets, we use the most up-to-date simulations of MIRI coronagraphic performance to generate detection probability maps for our observations. Comparing these estimates of our expected sensitivity with MIRI to the predicted mass and separations of the planet in the system allows us to identify three systems (GJ14, HD207129, and HD202628) in which we will have a high confidence of detecting a planet in each of the three systems with expected masses ranging from ~0.3 to 1.0 Jupiter masses. Not only will the identification of these planetary mass companions provide clear evidence that they are indeed responsible for sculpting the dust disk, but such objects will be ideal for subsequent follow-up observations for atmospheric characterization using the suite of wavelengths afforded by JWST.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe three nearby stars (GJ14, HD207129, and HD202628) using the MIRI four-quadrant phase mask (4QPM) coronagraph operating with the F1550C filter to search for gaseous planets responsible for sculpting sharp inner debris identified through ALMA imaging.

We will observe each of our science targets at two roll angles with an observation of a PSF reference star immediately adjacent to an observation of our target star. All our observations of science targets and PSF reference images share a timing link to achieve a higher overall correlation between the science and PSF reference images, translating to a better PSF subtraction, and better sensitivity to planets. To benefit from the best calibration strategies, in addition to reducing observatory overheads, all observations of our target and reference stars will be executed in a non-interruptible sequence.

Furthermore, two of our science targets (HD207129 and HD202628) have less than a 10 degree separation on the sky, and therefore they can be observed in sequence with a single reference star observation (HD201647) in between them. This configuration allows the two science targets to share a single reference star, resulting in a more efficient program. For this reference star, we have chosen a nine-point dither observation to generate more reference PSF images. Our third target, GJ14 will have its own reference star (HD5431) and use a five-point dither.
