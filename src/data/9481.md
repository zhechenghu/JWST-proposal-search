## ABSTRACT

Centaurs are small bodies scattered from the trans-Neptunian region, carrying invaluable information on the composition of trans-Neptunian objects. About 10% of centaurs show cometary activity, poorly understood and often unpredictable.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The observations proposed are to investige the gas species (e.g., CO, CH4, or CO2) driving the activity in the recently discovered active centaur C/2023 RS61 (PANSTARRS) using the JWST NIRSpec IFU Prism mode during Cycle 4. The observations have dedicated background observations due to the extended nature of the target's gas and dust comae. The science and background observations are sequenced together and non-interruptible to ensure the most accurate measure of the background. Also, HST WFC3/UVIS imaging data are to be collected close in time (+/- ~ 3 days) for high-resolution inner coma morphology data for a deeper understanding of the outburst vs. persistent low-level activity.
