## ABSTRACT

Monitor the thermal emission of the observatory using MIRI data at the longest wavelengths, where its contribution is the highest. The data is key to constrain the JWST Background model, an important component to determine the properties of long science exposures at those wavelengths The method relies on the experience obtained during Cycle3, where the monitoring began. MIRI Images at 25, 21, 18 and 12.8 micron are now included, in order to provide a more complete set of measurements for long wavelength imager filters. In all cases there are MRS simultaneous exposures, that are obtained in a selected region of the sky where the contribution of the Astronomical infrared background (ISM & Zodiacal light) is minimum, and therefore, the main contribution is dominated by the observatory thermal emission.
Based on a request of the project we have added 4 imager filters that would be tracked as well (F5600w, F1000W, F1280W & F1500W).

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This version of the program will target a field near then northern CVZ. Previous versions used a target in the southern CVZ in the LMC, which is too complex of a field in the infrared for our purposes.

Each epoch includes one observation with MRS in all three grating settings and five long-wavelength Imaging filters (12.8, 15, 18, 21 and 25um) in parallel, and using the "background" to do so, but the measuremts are meant to be valid by themselves.
