## ABSTRACT

Brown dwarfs (BDs) and free-floating planetary-mass objects (PMOs) represent a significant portion of the star-like population in the Galaxy. Yet their formation mechanism remains an open question. BDs are generally understood to form similarly to stars, exhibiting characteristics like disks and outflows. However, PMOs (masses < 12 MJup), may form either through cloud fragmentation (similar to stars) or through disk fragmentation followed by ejection (similar to planets). Microlensing surveys suggest an increase in PMO numbers below 20 MJup, conflicting with observations from nearby star-forming regions (SFRs), where a declining trend is noted. One possible reason is that PMOs are predominantly formed in massive, dense star forming regions, which are underrepresented in the solar neighbourhood. Here we propose to determine the number of PMOs in a massive dense cluster, where dynamical interactions might favor the ejections of free-floating planets. Our target for this proposal is RCW 38, the densest stellar cluster within 4 kpc around us, 10 times denser than the Orion Nebula Cluster. We have designed a survey that allows us to study its planetary-mass population and derive its Initial Mass Function down to 2-3 MJup using JWST's NIRCam. By comparing RCW 38 to other clusters, this study will shed light on the discrepancies between young and field planetary populations, offering critical insights into the processes that govern the formation of the lowest-mass objects in the Galaxy.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will obtain deep observations of the young star cluster RCW 38 using NIRCam, in 10 wide and medium filters. The goal is to reach a SNR > 10 down to F150W = 26 mag.
We will use two Readout modes, Medium2 which offers a good compromise between frame loss and the achieving the required depth, and Rapid in order to obtain larger dynamic range in the cluster (i.e. to have acess to a wide range in stellar masses).
Additionally, we will use an identical setup to observe a control field in the vicinity of the cluster, which will be used for statistical decontamination of the cluster member sequence in various CMDs available from different filter combinations. This will yield the numbers of expected members per magnitude and color bin, and consequently and estimate of the Initial Mass Function down to 2-3 MJup.
We will also use the photometry in various filters to construct objects' SEDs and help selecting candidates for future follow-ups.
