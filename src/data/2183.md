## ABSTRACT

Dust in the diffuse interstellar medium (DISM) is a major contributor to the energy balance and chemistry of interstellar gas and dust in galaxies. The DISM is fed by chemically diverse, partially crystalline stardust produced by evolved stars and supernovae, but amorphized and destroyed by interstellar shocks and radiation at rates that significantly exceed production. We therefore lack a fundamental understanding of the dust cycle in galaxies and its main elemental building blocks: C, O, Si, Mg, and Fe. We propose to use JWST's unique combination of wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and spectral resolution at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths to measure the abundance and determine the composition of the major C and O dust reservoirs in the Milky Way's DISM. We will detect the absorption fingerprint of DISM dust along carefully selected sightlines toward well-characterized background OB stars which lack strong ice features indicative of dense molecular cloud environments. This will allow us to answer several long-standing questions in the cycle of dust in galaxies, namely: what is the composition and lattice structure of DISM silicates? what is the nature of interstellar carbon dust? and what is the location of the missing oxygen in the DISM? Addressing these questions is of fundamental importance, because the DISM is the starting point for star and planet formation, setting the initial conditions for material that feeds into molecular clouds.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will use JWST NIRCAM grism spectroscopy and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy to detect and spectrally resolve dust absorption features in the diffuse interstellar medium by observing twelve distant O and B type stars: GSC 08152-02121, TYC 8989-436-1, CPD-59 583, CD-40 11169, TYC 7380-1046-1, TYC 6272-339-1, LS 4992, VI Cyg 1 [CPR2002] A38, ALS 15181, GSC 03157-00327 and 2MASS J20452110+4223513. These sources have extinctions that range between AV ~ 4.2 to 8.1 mag.
The NIRCAM observations are required to detect carbon features (hydrocarbon chains with CH2/CH3 groups compounds) at 3.4 um, and determine the photospheric level at 5 um. If trapped water ice in silicates is present along the line of sight toward these sources, features will be present at 2.9 and 6.0 micron with expected depths of ~1%.
Our goal is to obtain a NIRCAM spectrum for each target with S/N=300 at R=340 (0.01 micron) at 3.4 micron (sufficient to detect 1% absorption features). We will achieve this through spectral binning. The ETC S/N estimate is made per wavelength (2px/element), at 3.4 micron, R ~1600. A total gain over the ETC estimate of sqrt(9) is made by binning (to R=340) such that the S/N in the native resolution is 100.
The MIRI MRS observations are required to detect the silicate feature at 10 micron. We will observe using a 4 point dither, optimised for point sources. Our goal is to obtain a spectrum for each target with S/N=300 at R=1000 (0.01 micron) at 10 micron (again, sufficient to detect 1% absorption features). We will achieve this through spectral binning. The ETC S/N estimate is per wavelength (1.5 px/element) and native spectral resolution is 3,000 at 10 micron. A total gain in S/N over the ETC estimate of sqrt(4.5) is made by binning (to R=1000), such that the required S/N in the native spectral resolution is 140. The S/N across the spectrum will be higher at shorter wavelengths and lower at longer wavelengths.
