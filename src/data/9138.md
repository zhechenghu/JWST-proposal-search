## ABSTRACT

Quenching of massive galaxies is a significant challenge for cosmological models attempting to reproduce the observable Universe. A variety of quenching timescales are found in massive galaxies, with ~25% of them quenching in a duration of 500 Myr. AGN feedback is an important quenching mechanism, however, the small duration of an AGN phase (10-100 Myr) compared to the galaxy lifetime, makes it hard to connect these two. In this regard, restarted radio-AGN are unique, since they can be used to trace multiple epochs of AGN activity over hundreds of Myr. Restarted sources with sustained jet activity over 300-400 Myr, can suppress star formation, and quench massive galaxies over a short timescale. We propose NIRSpec fixed-slit mode observations of 4 restarted radio AGN at z~1 with massive quiescent host galaxies, to find evidence for the cumulative impact of AGN feedback. We plan to perform a stellar population modelling using spectrophotometric data, and determine the abundances of different stellar populations and the star formation history (SFH) of the galaxies. We will compare the young stellar population and recent SFH (<500 Myr) with the radio-AGN timescales, to find for the first time, evidence of cumulative AGN feedback. These observations, located at the cosmic midpoint of the Universe, will help constrain the quenching mechanisms in massive galaxies.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request NIRSpec fixed-slit mode observations of four restarted radio-AGN galaxies at z~1 with the G140M/F070 LP dispenser/filter. We aim to determine the stellar populations and star formation histories of these galaxies. We require S/N~20 at ~0.8-0.9 micron for our analysis, which includes using the Balmer lines at these wavelengths. We require 2 hrs of exposure time for three, and 1 hr exposure time for one target to achieve this. We summarise the setups below:
