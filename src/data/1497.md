## ABSTRACT

Parallel dark current observations are needed for NIRISS in the NISRAPID read-out mode. These are used to produce the dark current reference file and also for general health analysis for the instrument. This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and the final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We request NIRISS darks in the NISRAPID read-out for detector characterization and monitoring. The individual dark exposures have 120 groups/integration and 5 integrations per exposure. Observations are grouped in sets of two taken within a given two-week period, with 20 such sets within the year. Analogous darks for the NIS read-out and sub-array read-outs are requested in programs 1498 and 1499, scheduled in 6 two-week periods where there are gaps in the schedule of these darks.
