## ABSTRACT

This activity will obtain dark exposures for constructing the dark current, “master bias” and readnoise reference files for the supported subarrays used in Cycle 1. For each subarray, we will obtain one NRSRAPID dark exposure with nInt=100 and nGroups set such that each ramp is ~100s long. The first frame of each integration will be used to create the master bias reference file. For some subarray names, the subarray location depends on the grating in use; separate observations are obtained for these combinations.

This calibration program is provisional and may change in response to system developments and final science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

After the Cycle 1 science program was available it was noticed that nirspec users were using many more of the subarrays available and for longer durations then was expected. Analysis of ground data shows that the dark signal observed in our H2RG detectors is multiplexer glow, not dark current (for most pixels) and therefore it is a measured signal per frame not unit time. Accordingly, it can be decomposed with at least two measures of dark signal with a different number of reads per unit time but the same tuning. We can approximate this with the ALLSLITS subarray and full frame data using NRSRAPID readout. This method is being tested in commissioning and this program is updated to reflect an expected postive outcome from commissioning.

In cycle 1, we will use the ALLSLITS subarray and the G140M grating to monitor the dark current bimonthly over Cycle 1(2 observations of 265 groups, 6 integrations). This data will be used to monitor the trending bias level, dark current, and readnoise and overall pixel behavior. two thirds of the time in the program is alloted to the monitor, the other third takes traditional darks long enough to cover the longest duration science subarrays in cycle 1. The G140M grating is used as the generic case and normallly this observation will be the one appropriate for the gratings not used explicitly.

This program contains no specific observations for the TA and confirmation image subarrays.
The same data will be used to derive the master bias reference files using the 1st frame of each integration.
For the ALLSLITS subarray, the extra deep exposures are included to support long observations of faint objects.

Contingencies:
For some subarray names, the subarray location depends on the grating in use, and so for these settings multiple observations will be needed.

The exact subarrays included and the time required for this proposal may be adjusted based on the results of CAR NRS-039 and 21. The relative grating alignment may change after launch and the initial cool-down and this may require unique subarray locations for a different subset of the gratings. Also subarrays not expected to be used for science or calibratiton observations may not be observed, even if they are supported by OSS software.
