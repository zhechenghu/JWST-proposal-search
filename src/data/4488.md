## ABSTRACT

    We will observe the standard star J1802271 (A3 V) in the full array and all four subarrays in the F1280W filter to photometrically calibrate the subarrays to each other. This activity builds on the Cycle 1 activity, which used the same star in the F770W filter. The shift to a longer-wavelength filter will reduce detector systematics and provide a check for the previous results.

    This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    The duplicates of the FULL and SUB64 settings will test for differences in readout behavior when the previous readout was with a different subarray.

    All observations should be observed in one non-interruptible sequence.

    The observations are constrained to be observed before 1 Oct 2023.
