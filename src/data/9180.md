## ABSTRACT

The Ly-alpha damping wing signature imprinted on the spectra of high-z QSOs by the foreground neutral IGM provides the most mature and credible method for measuring the Universe's reionization history. We applied a state-of-the-art analysis pipeline to the spectra of 41 bright QSO spectra (37 ground-based, 4 JWST), which accounts for the patchiness of reionization, the unknown QSO lifetime, continuum reconstruction error, and spectral noise, allowing us to disentangle the IGM damping wing from the QSO's unknown intrinsic spectrum. After marginalizing out nuisance parameters associated with the QSO continuum and lifetime, we find that reionization occurred gradually, is highly patchy, and ends late, quantitatively confirming past qualitative claims based on the Ly-a forest and reionization simulations. A battery of tests performed on hundreds of mocks demonstrates the reliability of this methodology. These tantalizing results exhaust existing bright QSOs observable from the ground, representing 500+ hours of 8m-class time. A fundamental prediction of the IGM models is that fainter QSOs (J_AB > 22) exhibit far stronger damping wings than bright QSOs because of the reduced impact of ionization by the QSO itself. We propose a NIRSpec spectroscopic survey (G140H, G235H, G395M) of 27 QSOs at z>6.5, which, combined with existing spectra, will yield a sample of 68, enabling measurement of the cosmic reionization history to 5%. The jointly inferred QSO lifetimes will further enable reconstruction of their distribution, to be compared to SMBH masses and Eddington ratios (determined from the same spectra). This experiment is only achievable with the exquisite sensitivity of JWST.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We are targeting 27 quasars at 6.5 < z < 7.4 with NIRSpec in fixed slit mode through the G140H/F070LP, G235H/F170LP, and G395M/F290LP filter in order to observe the spectrum from the proximity zone up to the MgII 2798 emission line and measure precise [OIII]-systemic redshifts. The 395M observations are obtained only for the 11 QSOs which do not have precise systemic redshifts from sub-mm observations of host ISM emission lines.

Below is the summary of the observing plan:
NIRSpec FS OBSERVATION
All 27 quasars will be placed in the slits S200A1 and S200A2 in order to fill the detector spectral gap for G140 and G235H.
All targets will be observed through G140H/F070LP and G235H/F170LP to do spectroscopy from 1170 to 3000 Angstrom in the rest-frame to model their IGM damping wings and measure SMBH masses from the MgII 2798 emission line.
For 11 targets we also obtain G395M/F290LP to measure systemic-zs and also SMBH masses.
We will use WATA for target acquisition.
