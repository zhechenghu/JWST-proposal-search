## ABSTRACT

On August 19th, 2024, JWST made an observation of a thermal light echo from the Cas A supernova that has started a new era in the study of the ISM. The sub-structures, most clearly detected in the longest wavelength filters of NIRCam, show never-before seen structures down to 500 AU scales that we believe probe the typical cold neutral medium (CNM) and fundamental ISM processes. We propose here a program that will (A) measure the morphological diversity of these sub-structures (B) provide enough photometric depth to probe an intriguing density-complexity relationship (C) reconstruct the true 3D sub-structure of the CNM at <0.01 pc resolution.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

There are two main components of this proposal: Firstly, a single-band, single epoch survey targeting 10 of the thermal light echoes from Cas A; secondly, a 15-epoch survey focusing on a subset of 3 of these Cas A thermal light echoes.

For the first epoch of the observations, we will observe all 10 targets in a non-interruptable sequence. In each of the remaining 14 epochs, we will observe the 3 of the multi-epoch targets in a non-interruptable sequence. The epochs are required to be spaced in 14 day increments relative to the original observing epoch, with a +/- 2 day tolerance for each epoch. I.e., epoch 2 will happen 12-16 days after epoch 1; epoch 3 will happen 26-30 days after epoch 1. This spacing provides the required temporal resolution, and hence physical resolution, to enable our reconstruction of the 3D structure of the ISM.

For all targets, the individual observations in each epoch are all conducted in the same way. Specifically, we observe with F444W in NIRCam LW (the filter which is our main science objective), and F200W and F070W in NIRCam SW. Every observation consists of 1 integration of 8 groups, with the SHALLOW4 readout mode; as per JDOX, this the recommended strategy for optimal observing per depth, given the depth required for our observations. Every observation uses the INTRAMODULEX dither pattern with 4 dither pointings, to optimise observing time for a given full-depth coverage; the 8 groups per integration, at each of the 4 dither positions, should provide good cosmic ray rejection.
