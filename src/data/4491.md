## ABSTRACT

We will observe wavelength standards in the LRS slit and in the LRS slitless mode in order to improve on the existing wavelength dispersion solution for the LRS. One target for each mode duplicates a target from Commissioning or Cycle 1 in order to check for possible variations in the dispersion and to build signal/noise. The third target is a high-redshift object chosen to move strong near-infrared emission lines into the 5-7 um range in order to better constrain the dispersion solution in the slit.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

All observations are set to occur after 1 Sep 2023.
That timing will give the MIRI/LRS team further time to assess the results of Cycle 1 cal and make modifications if necessary.
