## ABSTRACT

The amount of dust outside of galaxies, inferred from reddened background sources, is comparable to that within galaxies. The recent discoveries of dusty winds driven by stellar and SMBH processes that extend on 100-kpc scales suggest that winds are one source, and possibly the main source, of the enriched circumgalactic medium (CGM), although the processes by which the dust is launched, entrained, and possibly altered in these winds remain uncertain. This is due to the fact that the angular resolution (<2") of present-day observations is insufficient to extract the dust signal at the base of the wind against the bright galaxy, and allow to pinpoint where the dust lies relative to the cool, warm, and hot gas phases of the winds. We propose to map, for the first time on sub-arcsec scale (<10-100 pc), the warm dust and H2 in 10 nearby highly inclined disk galaxies with well-known galactic winds or fountains, spanning a range in stellar masses (metallicity), energy sources (stellar or AGN), and dust erosion processes (shocks, stellar or AGN photoionization). The PAH 3.3, 7.7, 11.3, H2 17.03, and adjacent continuum emission will be compared with existing sub-arcsec maps and velocity fields of the ionized gas to determine the mechanisms by which the dust is launched and carried into the halos of these galaxies, and whether dust grains and warm H2 molecules evolve as the wind carries them to form the CGM. The <10-100 pc resolution is critical since the processes that can alter the dust and clouds in which it resides operate on such scales. The results will inform future modeling and HST/UV observations. The proprietary period is shortened given the legacy value of the data.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will image each galaxy, except M82, NGC 253, and NGC 891 (see below), using MIRI and NIRCam with the following settings:

-Deep MIRI 2 x 1 mosaic without PA constraints centered on the nucleus (easy to schedule)
FULL array
4-point extended source dither pattern
Readout mode: FASTR1
Filters F560W, F770W, F1130W, F1500W, and F1800W
(sequentially, in order of increasing wavelength to avoid persistence)
F560W: 70 groups and 1 integrations per dither position
F770W: 6 groups and 5 integrations per dither position
F1130W: 15 groups and 2 integrations per dither position
F1500W: 16 groups and 3 integrations per dither position
F1800W: 8 groups and 5 integrations per dither position
No off-source background images (except for M82 and NGC 253; see below)

-Deep NIRCam 1x1 mosaic without PA constraints centered on the nucleus (easy to schedule)
Module B only
FULL array
Primary dither = INTERMODULEX, 2 dither position, STANDARD subpixel dither, 2 subpixel positions
Readout mode: MEDIUM8
Filters F335M (long) and F187N or F182M (short) simultaneously
4 groups and 1 integrations per dither position
No off-source background images

F182M instead of F187N is selected to fully capture the redshifted Pa-alpha in the four galaxies and their outflows and rotating galactic disks with redshifts z>~0.005 (NGC 1482, NGC 4388, NGC 4666, and NGC 5775), at the expense of additional contamination from the underlying continuum.

-To avoid saturation issues: MIRI snapshots of the central region without PA constraints (easy to schedule)
SUB128 subarray
4-point extended source dither pattern
Readout mode: FASTR1
Filters F560W, F770W, F1130W, F1500W, and F1800W: 5 group and 1 integration per dither position
(sequentially, in order of increasing wavelength to avoid persistence)

-To avoid saturation issues: NIRCam images of the central region without PA constraints (easy to schedule)
Module B only
SUB640 subarray
Primary dither = INTERMODULEBOX, 2 dither position, STANDARD subpixel dither, 2 subpixel positions
Readout mode: RAPID
Filters F335M (long) and F187N or F182M (short) simultaneously
4 groups and 1 integrations per dither position
No off-source background images

Here and again, F182M instead of F187N is selected to fully capture the redshifted Pa-alpha in the four galaxies and their outflows + rotating galactic disks with redshifts z>~0.005 (NGC 1482, NGC 4388, NGC 4666, and NGC 5775), at the expense of additional contamination from the underlying continuum.

For M82, NGC 253, and NGC 891, we use the exact same settings but avoid duplication with existing or planned observations. M82 and NGC 253 are observed only with MIRI F1500W and F1800W, while NGC 891 is only observed with MIRI F1130W, F1500W, and F1800W and NIRCam F335W and F187N. For M82 and NGC 253, we also obtain off-source background MIRI images since their winds completely fill the MIRI FOV. These background images use the same settings as the science images except for the use of the 2-point extended source dither pattern to reduce overheads.
