## ABSTRACT

One of the major discoveries from the IRAS mission was of a population of extremely luminous, or "Ultraluminous" Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) having infrared luminosities above 10^12 Lsun. ULIRGs emit more than 90% of their luminosity in the mid and far-infrared from dust, and they are ideal local laboratories for studying star formation, the growth of supermassive black holes and the effects of energetic feedback and galactic winds in galactic mergers. ULIRGs offer a rare, high-resolution look into dynamic processes that occur much more frequently in rapidly evolving galaxies at high-redshift. In the mid-infrared, ULIRGs show a large range of spectral properties including emission from ionized atomic and warm molecular gas, warm dust and stochastically heated smalll dust grains, together with absorption from ices and warm and cold molecular gas. Despite extensive study with ground and space based telescopes, there are still a number of outstanding questions about the physics of ULIRGs that can be uniquely addressed with the advanced capabilities of JWST. We propose to obtain MIRI MRS and NIRSPec spectra along with MIRI and NIRCam imaging of 15 ULIRGs to complete the study of the mid-infrared properties of a flux-limited sample of the brightest ULIRGs in the local Universe at unprecedented sensitivity and spatial-spectral resolution. These data will be valuable in their own right, and they will provide a rich legacy for studies of the distant Universe with JWST and future infrared telescopes.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Using MIRI, NIRSpec we will undertake a spectroscopic study of a flux limited sample of Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies in the local Universe. We will observe 15 ULIRGs out of a complete sample of 23 from the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample. We will obtain full coverage with MIRI and will use the G395H/F290LP grating/filter combination on NIRSpec. All on-source IFU pointings are single position, centered on the IR-bright nuclei. Three sources have two IFU pointings each, since their merging nuclei are separated by distances comparable to the size of the (short wavelength) IFUs and cannot fit in a single pointing.

We are also obtaining 4-band NIRCam imaging data with the F150W/F277W and F200W/F356W filters on NIRCam and the F560W, F777W and F1500W filters on MIRI. Our MIRI MRS background observations are all performed with POS-TARG offsets in order to place the MIRI imager field on the target during the background observations. For some sources this requires aperture P.A. constraints to avoid nearby bright stars and/or galaxies, but these contraints are not very impacful as the star densities are low. All observations of a given target also have a Non-interruptible group constraint to avoid contamination from bright sources between observations and extra slew overheads.

We use BRIGHTSKY mode for most targets. We have added dedicated MIRI SUB128 and NIRCam SUB160P sub-array images for the brightest targets, IR05189 and IR08572 since they may saturate even with the minimum recommended number of groups, if all the MIR flux is unresolved from the nucleus.
