## ABSTRACT

Recent analysis of NIRSpec observations of the dwarf planet Makemake has revealed the unexpected detection of methane gas fluorescence, making Makemake only the second trans-Neptunian object, after Pluto, with confirmed evidence of gaseous volatiles. This discovery raises fundamental questions about the origin of the emission, which can be equally well explained by a gravitationally bound atmosphere or an expanding coma driven by sublimation or cryovolcanic activity. Independent measurements have hinted at possible cryovolcanism on Makemake. If the emission is cryovolcanic in origin (i.e., plume-like activity), it may be transient, making timely follow-up essential. The current G395M data lack the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio needed to discriminate between these scenarios. We propose timely follow-up observations with the NIRSpec IFU using the G395H grating, which will resolve individual methane fluorescence lines, allowing us to accurately model the continuum and measure relative line intensities, necessary to distinguish a coma from a bound atmosphere. To probe potential spatial and temporal variability, we request three observations spaced 120 degrees apart in rotational phase, accommodating uncertainty in Makemake's rotation period and ensuring coverage of the same longitude observed in 2023. Given the unknown nature of the phenomenon, early observations are critical. If the methane emission is transient, it may fade before Cycle 5; conversely, a non-detection would place the first constraints on its lifetime. Either outcome will provide unique insight into volatile release and surface-atmosphere interactions on distant icy worlds.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We plan to observe Makemake with the NIRSpec IFU during the earliest observing window within Cycle 4 (2025 Dec 29 - 2026 Feb 24) in order to characterize its gaseous volatile emission while it may still be ongoing. The observations will utilize the G395H grating to yield the highest possible spectral resolution, which will allow us to robustly resolve the individual emission peaks and accurately model the fluorescence signal. The target signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element is 16 at 3.346 microns, which translates to 11 per wavelength element. Following standard practice for solar system object observations, we will use the four-point dither pattern and the NRSIRS2RAPID readout pattern.

Three separate observations are requested to acquire different longitudinal views of Makemake. These visits are scheduled at 0, 120, and 240 degrees phase assuming a 22.8266 hr rotational period, with the additional timing constraint that the three observations take place within five days. This will allow us to disentangle longitudinal variability from possible temporal variations in the volatile production.
