## ABSTRACT

Where and how habitable planets can be formed is a long-standing 'big question' in astronomy. To answer it, one of the keys is to study the chemical evolution during star formation processes. In recent decades, complex organic molecules (COMs) have attracted great interest as they are the first step from simple species toward the building blocks of life. So far, around 100 COMs have been detected in the gas phase using radio telescopes such as ALMA, and most of the detections were made toward protostars. However, increasing evidence suggests that their formation starts in the solid phase on grain surfaces during early pre-stellar stages, and the observed gas is sublimated from the icy mantles. Very recently, the existence of COM ices is verified by the secure detection in three protostars using JWST/MIRI-MRS. Now, with the feasibility of observing COMs in both phases, a significant follow-up is to probe their chemical evolution by comparing their abundances between ice and gas. In previous cycles, this idea has been successfully proposed for a decent sample of low- and intermediate-mass sources, while similar observations for high-mass sources are still limited. We therefore propose MIRI/MRS observations for 15 high-mass protostars that are carefully selected from public ALMA surveys. All of these sources have shown to harbor rich gas-phase COMs and in the meantime are suitable for MIRI-MRS observations (i.e. not saturated, not too faint and time-consuming). If accepted, we will obtain an invaluable treasure of mid-IR spectra for a large sample of high-mass protostars and greatly boost our understanding about the chemical evolution of COMs and other simple molecules.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose JWST/MIRI-MRS observations for 15 high-mass protostars that have been revealed to harbor rich lines of gas-phase complex organic molecules (COMs) by ALMA surveys at millimeter wavelengths. The immediate goal is to detect the ice features of COMs in the critical range of 6.8 to 8.8 micron, and make comparisons in their abundances between gas and ice in the same sources. All the channels of MRS are requested to cover a full range of 5-28 micron. Integration times are designed to achieve an SNR of 300 at Channels 1C-2B (6.53-10.13 micron) to cover the fingerprint range of COM ices and a methanol band at 9.74 micron. We used the default FASTR1 readout pattern for all the observations. Simultaneous MIRI imaging was switched on to capture the morphology of surrounding high-mass star-forming regions. A 4-point dither is applied to improve the spatial and spectral sampling of extended sources. A dedicated background observation at a dark and nearby location is assigned to each target and linked with the on-source observation as 'non-interruptible'.
