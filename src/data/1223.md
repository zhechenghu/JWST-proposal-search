## ABSTRACT

    We will use the NIRSpec Integral-Field Unit to obtain complete 1-5.3 micron spectra of the nucleus of NGC4654, a rare example of a galactic nucleus harboring two massive star clusters in the process of merging. The data will enable us to measure the ages, stellar populations, and velocities of the two clusters. These results will put stringent constraints on competing theories for the formation of massive compact objects (be it massive nuclear star clusters or super-massive black holes) in galactic nuclei.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

    We will use the NIRSpec Integral-Field Unit to obtain complete 1-5.3 micron spectra of the nucleus of NGC4654, a rare example of a galactic nucleus harboring two massive star clusters in the process of merging. The data will enable us to measure the ages, stellar populations, and velocities of the two clusters. These results will put stringent constraints on competing theories for the formation of massive compact objects (be it massive nuclear star clusters or super-massive black holes) in galactic nuclei. For each of the three high-resolution gratings, we will execute a compact 4-point dither pattern, followed by a single "leakage" exposure at the first dither position.
