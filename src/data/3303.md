## ABSTRACT

**2. Full ABSTRACT**

With this proposal we aim to study archival data of z$>$5 candidate JWST Star-Forming-Galaxies and Early QSO from the COSMOS-Webb, CEERS and PEARLS in conjunction with deep Chandra archival data to probe the early Universe by means of stacking analysis. Our goal is to determine a) constrain the high-z Star Formation Rate (SFR)-L$_X$ efficiency by deriving Chandra X-ray luminosities and SFRs obtained by JWST; b) the abundance of AGN-like X-ray sources at z>5 in order to shed new light on early SMBH growth and c) compute the space density and X-ray throughput of early AGN candidates and compare them with predictions of SMBH seeding models.
