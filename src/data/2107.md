## ABSTRACT

We propose a Treasury program to obtain 2-21 micron NIRCam+MIRI imaging of the unique sample of 19 nearby (d < 20 Mpc) star-forming main sequence galaxies with public HST, ALMA, and VLT-MUSE data. By resolving IR emission across these 19 morphologically diverse galaxies into individual regions and clusters (5-50 pc scales), the proposed JWST measurements will enable a complete inventory of star formation activity in our targets, accurately measure the mass and age of their stellar clusters, pinpoint the youngest embedded clusters, and reveal the physical state of the small dust grains that heat the ISM. We will generate and rapidly release high level data products that will fuel diverse, high impact science in the fields of star formation, feedback, ISM physics and galaxy evolution. In combination with UV-optical Hubble imaging of 10,000 clusters, MUSE spectroscopy mapping of 20,000 HII regions, and 12,000 ALMA-identified molecular clouds, our team will use the Treasury data to measure the timescales and efficiencies of the earliest phases of star formation and stellar feedback, build the first empirical model of how small dust grain properties depend on local ISM conditions, and quantitatively establish how dust-reprocessed starlight traces star formation activity and mass, all across a representative range of conditions in the z=0 universe. In short, this Treasury will provide a revolutionary data set to the JWST community early on, spur major scientific advances, and build on recent legacy programs of HST, ALMA and MUSE.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We target 19 nearby, star-forming galaxies with NIRCam and MIRI imaging. We cover the main star-forming area of the disks of each galaxy, matched to coverage from Hubble, VLT-MUSE, and ALMA, with 1-4 pointing mosaics. Specifically, we use 1-2 pointings for NIRCam and 2-4 pointings for MIRI, per galaxy. For both NIRCam and MIRI we use 10% overlap between rows and columns of mosaic tiles. To maximize observing efficiency, we operate MIRI in parallel - pointing at blank sky during the NIRCam observation.

For the NIRCam observations, we use the B Module and an INTRAMODULEBOX dither pattern with 4 primary dithers. We obtain four F200W observations with the BRIGHT1 readout pattern (two with 5 groups/integration and 4 dithers, yielding 386.5s, and two with 3 groups/integration and 4 dithers, yielding 214.7s). In total, our full F200W exposure time is 1,202s. Simultaneously with F200W in the LW filter, we observe with F300M, F335M, and F360M. F300M and F335M are paired with the longer F200W exposures, 386.5s each. In the last two F200W exposures, both are with F360M, for a total exposure time of 429.4s.

For the MIRI observations, we use a 4-point dither pattern optimized for extended sources. We observe with the F770W, F1000W, F1130W and F2100W filters. These observations use the FAST readout pattern and the following groups x integrations: 8x1 (88.8s), 11x1 (122.1s), 28x1 (310.8s), 14x2 (310.8s), for F770W, F1000W, F1130W, and F2100W, respectively. Because the target fills the MIRI field of view, we also obtain a background measurement using the same exposure pattern and dithering for a blank region of sky near the galaxy.

We include the following special requirements: 1) a timing requirement that ensures the MIRI background (which is in parallel with the NIRCam observation of the galaxy) occurs directly following the MIRI observation of the target; 2) position angle requirements to ensure that the MIRI observations will overlap the coverage of the existing HST, MUSE, ALMA maps, 3) position angle requirements to ensure that the NIRCam observations will also overlap the coverage of the existing HST, MUSE, ALMA map, but that the MIRI background observation, which is taken in parallel, will be pointed to blank sky. We have attempted to widen the orient constraints to maximize the observability windows with a resulting minimum window of 2 weeks.
