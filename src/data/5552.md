## ABSTRACT

To date, there exists no systematic view examining the chemistry of protostellar systems in the gas- and condensed-phases at all size and temperature scales from the cold dark cloud to the embedded protostar and its emerging protoplanetary disks. As a result we are missing critical information about the emergence of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium, a fundamental puzzle of astrochemistry. Here, we propose a program to link the large-scale, cold chemistry of protostellar envelopes to the small-scale, warm gas toward emerging protostars and their protoplanetary disks. This will be done through NIRSpec MOS observations of a sample of eight protostars known to harbor hot corinos with abundant complex organic molecules present on small scales. The JWST observations will provide the large scale view of the distribution of fundamental ices in the parental cloud of these sources. These observations, combined with complementary ALMA Large Programs will provide the most comprehensive and systematic view of the chemical evolution of gas and ice around protostars in different environments so-far. The resulting insights will fundamentally alter our understanding of the complex chemistry arising around young protostars and will allow us to address the fundamental question: what role do natal molecular cloud conditions play in setting the organic inventories that eventually may be inherited from emerging planetary systems?

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We propose to obtain map the distribution of interstellar ices in the natal cloud environments of eight deeply embedded protostars known from ALMA observations to harbor hot corinos with abundant complex organic molecules. In conjunction with data from an ongoing ALMA Large Program, COMPASS, providing systematic inventories of the complex organic species in the gas-phase on disk-scales (< 100 au) as well as ALMA mosaicing observations of the molecules on core-to-cloud scales (~0.1-0.5 pc), these data will provide the most comprehensive view of the evolution of gas and ices from cloud to disk scales around protostars in different environments.

For each source we will first do NIRCam pre-imaging (6' x 5' FOV) to identify background stars for which ice absorption spectra can be obtained. An analysis of the number of background stars as well as experience from other programs show that the number density of those stars are sufficient to map distribution of ices on similar scales as what can be achieved with the ALMA Compact Array sensitive to the most extended structures. Based on the astrometric measurements from the pre-imaging and alignment with GAIA stars, we will be able to precisely position the MSA and decide which shutters to close to avoid saturation in case of bright sources within the FOV. With our selection of NIRSpec gratings and filters we will cover the wavelength range from 1.66 to 6.10 micron. This will allow us to measure the spectral absorption features against the background star continua to estimate the column densities of fundamental ices such as CO, CO2, H2O, and CH3OH.
