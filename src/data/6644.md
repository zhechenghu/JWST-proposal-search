## ABSTRACT

The solar analogue G31 in NGC 2506 is faint enough that even full frame NIRSpec NRSRAPID IRS2 MOS observations allow 3 groups before saturation.
But the only NIRSpec observations tying this to brighter standards use the SUB512 subarray which lacks real reference pixels. To ensure a good tie to brighter standards, we will also observe this star with the NIRSpec PRISM using both SUB2048 NRSRAPID and FULL Frame NRSIRS2RAPID readouts. In addition we will obtain G140M+G235M+G395M spectra which will allow more detailed spectral fitting of this star and which, when compared to brighter standards, will allow the NIRSpec linearity to be checked at lower count rates. Finally, we will also observe this star with PRISM in the S200A1, S200A2, and S400A1 apertures. Existing standard star observations in these slits with the PRISM saturate in less than 2 NRSRAPID groups and observations of this fainter star will allow improved derivation of the sensitivity at these wavelengths, while at longer wavelengths, we will combine these observations with the SUB2048 fixed slit observations to improve our measurement of the flux of this standard at long wavelengths.
This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

All observations will use the solar analogue star G31 in the open cluster NGC 2506.

This star is just faint enough that for NIRSpec MOS PRISM observations that three NRSIRS2RAPID groups can be obtained before the spectrum begins to saturate at the most sensitive wavelengths, and so it is valuable to have redundant verification of the spectral energy distribution.

The SUB200A1, SUB200A2, and SUB400A1 exposures use the corresponding NIRSpec apertures. All other observations use the S1600A1.

Results of ETC calculations for each proposed exposure are summarized below for the planned exposure sequences, (groups x integrations x dithers). For the PRISM observations, also listed are the number of NRSIRS2RAPID groups at which the counts at the most sensitive wavelength first reach saturation.
