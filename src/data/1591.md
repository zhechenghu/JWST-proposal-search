## ABSTRACT

This is a NIRSpec IFU proposal to measure the 1-5 µm spectrum of a few select objects known to have well-studied PAH features longward of 5 µm. Apart from the 3.3 µm PAH band and ~3.2-3.6 µm plateau, PAH spectroscopy across this region has been widely overlooked. The PAH model predicts many important, but weaker, features between 1-5 µm. JWST's unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution, and continuous 1-5 μm wavelength coverage make it possible, for the first time, to measure and fully characterize these features. Although, far weaker than the well-known bands, their frequencies and relative intensities contain fundamental information about the interstellar PAH population that is not accessible through the 5-15 µm PAH bands, such as the amount of cosmic nitrogen and deuterium sequestered in PAHs. The goal is to make interstellar PAH spectroscopy a more precise and complete probe of their environments by expanding the spectral bandwidth to include the full 1-5 µm range. Since PAHs play important roles in the astrophysics of many different astronomical environments, from H2 formation to cloud collapse times and complex prebiotic molecule formation in planet forming regions, these observations will fundamentally impact our understanding of many astrophysical processes. PAH features are going to be an important part of many, if not most, of the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI measured spectra and this will likely be the last opportunity to measure the weak PAH and PAH related emission features in the 1-5 µm region for a very long time. It is extremely important to get the most out of NIRSpec concerning PAHs as is possible at this time. The proposed observations will do just that.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Seven extended nebula will be observed in the NIRSpec G140M/F100LP (0.97-1.89 µm), G235M/F170LP (1.66 -3.17 µm), and G395M/F290LP (2.87-5.27 μm) filters. One object is targeted twice and has an independent background observation. One other target also has an independent background, while four are without any. The final target is organized in a Target Group. If need-be, spatial- and spectral resolution can be exchanged for an increased signal-to-noise.
