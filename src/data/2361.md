## ABSTRACT

Spectroscopic and polarimetric studies of a subset of the L-type asteroids has indicated that these objects may contain ~30% calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs), the first solids to condense out of the disk during the Solar System's formation. This is a surprising result because even the most CAI-abundant meteorites contain only 3-5% of these inclusions. High CAI content is considered to be indicator of ancient origin, and the confirmation of the CAI abundance in these asteroids would make them plausibly the most ancient objects in the Solar System. In addition, their existence has important implications for the timing of events in the Solar System's early history and the origins of the Solar System's raw materials. The spinel that is a major constituent of CAIs has prominent spectral signatures in the mid-IR, and mid-IR spectroscopy would readily detect this material and robustly differentiate high-CAI bodies from other candidate asteroid compositions. We propose to observe a set of L-type asteroids with high apparent CAI content in order to confirm or refute the high-CAI hypothesis, and to constrain the disk formation region and thermal/aqueous alteration histories of these unusual objects.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will use MIRI/MRS and NIRSPEC to obtain 2.5-28 micron spectra of five L-Type asteroids that have high purported CAI fractions.
