## ABSTRACT

Program for re-checking previously masked shorts, as the expectation is that some (many?) could have been transient, and the shutters could be resurrected for science operations.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 4 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

**OBJECTIVE:** The MSA control electronics (MCE) sporadically suffer electrical shorts, in which an unintended (and perhaps temporary) pathway bridges circuitry from a quadrant row or column (generically referred to as a line) to the substrate or another line. When a new short appears, the affected line should be identified and then masked, adding a full quadrant line to a dedicated mask in the MCE, effectively removing all the shutters in that line (171 or 365) from operations (this cannot be overruled by an MSA user pattern). This calibration program supports re-checking previously masked shorts, as the expectation is that some (many?) could have been transient, and the shutters could be resurrected for science operations.

**METHOD:** Re-checking of shorts follows the method described in the primary contingency OSD (CAL-NRS-406) program, with the temporary activation of one or more test mask(s) which removes the line(s) to be checked.

**JUSTIFICATION:** Short masking has, until now, been purely additive. However, transient shorts are a known phenomenon, raising the possibility that some previously masked shorts are no longer there. Short masking is currently responsible for the largest population of unusable shutters, and each masked row (dispersion direction) directly impacts multiplexing. All shorts since launch have been benign (no danger to the hardware) so there is no risk in re-checking them.

**PREVIOUS CALIBRATIONS:** A shorts re-checking program (PID 4469) was first introduced in Cycle 2 in anticipation of the development of SOC/OSS capability to apply test masks in the OP, which enables OSD and shorts re-checking without requiring cumbersome real-time commanding. This functionality was delivered in December 2023. This program was first executed in Cycle 3 with results-based path forward discussions underway as of this writing.

**TIMING CONSTRAINTS:** This program differs from the contingency ESD (CAL-NRS-405) and OSD (CAL-NRS-406) programs as it is not driven by unpredictable events but can be injected into the timeline when most efficient or most appropriate.

**DURATION (total hours):** An example shorts rechecking sequence with 2 test masks using the OP-driven mask handling, with a pair of diagnostic CHKBD3x3 exposures taken after each test mask activation, took ~0.92 hours (or approximately 1650 seconds each).

**COMMENTS:** Only shorts appearing since launch will be considered initially for rechecking, with rows (dispersion direction) given priority as they have the highest impact on multiplexing. Note that because a visit using the masking template can only apply masks of one type (ZPM or TSM), the number of visits required to restore the original masks at the end of an execution of MSA Shorts Checking depends on the number of test mask types used.
Note that the 14 sequences contained herein are placeholders in which the specific mask files will be added when specific recheck attempts are planned and test mask files tested.
These sequences allow for the independent rechecking of each of the 14 shorts masked in flight (that hasn't already been rechecked). Depending on available resources, the NIRSpec team may opt not to recheck all masked-in-flight shorts in Cycle 4. In some cases analysis may support the feasibility of rechecking multiple previously-masked shorts in a single test mask to optimize observatory efficiency.
A subset of these sequences could also be used, depending on available resources.
