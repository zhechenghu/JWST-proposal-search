## ABSTRACT
Understanding the mechanisms that yield the formation of extended Lyman-alpha halos in the environment of massive galaxies and how this process relates to the formation of early structures (z>4) has been challenging. With JWST, we can now access the rest-frame optical regime that traces the ionized gas and stellar components necessary to constrain the feedback processes and galaxy growth in distant galaxies.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will characterize different processes happening within the protocluster. Using NIRSpec/IFU observations of the central pair of galaxies we will obtain Halpha emission observations and reveal the true nature of the previously detected Ly-alpha and [CII] emission. Additionally, we will perform NIRSpec/MOS observations of galaxy members of the protocluster that, together with NIRCam imaging from a public program (COSMOS-Web), will provide the key parameters (stellar mass and metallicity) to constrain their evolutionary phase and compare with models of galaxy evolution inside protoclusters and overdense regions.
