## ABSTRACT

Quarterly NIRCam PIL images are requested to monitor the state of the primary mirror. PIL images will be inspected to identify and characterize features due to micro-meteoroid degradation, both those previously identified in WFE maps from phase retrieval and those for which the damage from individual micro-meteoroid are below the detection threshold in phase retrieval but are readily identifiable in PIL images. The features will be analyzed with detailed physical optical models in an effort to gain further knowledge of the shape and magnitude of the damage, both in WFE and reflectivity, beyond what can be derived from phase retrieval. The goal is to use the results to accumulate statistical knowledge of the distribution of degradation, for the purpose of characterizing and monitoring observatory throughput and WFE and perhaps informing operations in strategies to minimize future degradation.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Four Epochs of Primary Mirror monitoring observations using the NIRCam PIL template with the F140M and F210M filters on a K=7th magnitude star (taken from the pool of targets for the Routine WFS&C program).
2 Extra targets have been included in this program (and are not used at first) as backups in case any of the selected targets turns out to be an unknown binary.
