## ABSTRACT

We propose to do analysis of the low- albedo asteroid data being collected as part of JWST Guaranteed Time Programs #1244 and #1245: NIRSpec Prism spectra for the Trojan asteroids Hektor and Patroclus and both NIRSpec Prism spectra and MIRI MRS spectra for the main-belt asteroids Ceres, Pallas, and Hygiea and the near-Earth asteroid Phaethon.

The data will be used to address the following broad science questions, as detailed below:
1. What is the range of hydrated mineral composition and amount of hydrated material present on the surfaces of low-albedo asteroids?

As well as a “data handling” question:
2. How can useful spectral information best be extracted from saturated JWST data?

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This is a proposal to analyze data to be obtained through GTO programs 1244 and 1245. No observations are requested as a part of this program.
