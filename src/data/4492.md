| Nod 1 scan     | MIRI Low Resolution Spectroscopy  | (1) BD+60\_1753    |

## ABSTRACT

This activity will improve our understanding of the MIRI LRS slit throughput as a function of wavelength and position in the slit by scanning a point source across the slit at the two nominal nod positions. These scans will be the same scans used in Cycle 1. The data will also check the point-spread function (PSF) far from its center and improve our calibration for extended sources. These observations will improve the signal/noise ratio from similar work in Cycle 1 and Commissioning. This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 2 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

This activity scans the standard star BD+60 1753 across the LRS slit in the two nod positions.
