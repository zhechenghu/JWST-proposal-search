## ABSTRACT

The results of Herschel and Spitzer imaging surveys of nearby Galactic clouds suggest that most stars form in dense molecular filaments, which are often dark at near- to mid-IR wavelengths. The Herschel results support a filament paradigm for at least solar-type star formation, whereby Jeans-like fragmentation of 0.1-pc-wide supercritical filaments produces < 0.1pc prestellar cores, which subsequently collapse to protostars. The validity and details of this paradigm are much debated, however, and the detailed fragmentation manner of filaments remains a puzzle. Despite ongoing debates, the properties of dense filaments are thought to be representative of the initial conditions of most star formation in the Galaxy. We propose to exploit the unique resolution and sensitivity of JWST in the mid-IR to determine the radial density structure and fragmentation spacing properties of a sample of 6 infrared-dark filaments at different locations in the Galactic disk with unprecedented accuracy. The proposed observations will resolve the thermal Jeans length < 0.02 pc, provide a deep census of starless dense cores down to the Jeans mass, and determine the core mass function in each filament. The results will be compared with numerical simulations of filament fragmentation. They will be used to test the simple picture, tentatively suggested by recent ALMA findings, that the average filament width and core spacing remain roughly the same in all filaments, but that the typical core mass scales ~ linearly with the line mass of the parent filament. If confirmed by the proposed MIRI study, this will have profound implications for our understanding of the origin of the initial mass function.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Using mid-infrared absorption mapping with MIRI at 7.7 microns (F770W filter), we will characterize the radial density structure and fragmentation spacing properties of six Galactic infrared dark filaments with unprecedented accuracy. Thanks to the unique subarcsec resolution and sensitivity provided by JWST/MIRI around 8 microns, close to the minimum of the mid-infrared absorption curve, we will be able to probe the presence of dense starless cores down to a 5sigma sensitivity limit of 5x10^-3 to 0.6 Msun in the target filaments. The densest, most massive filament will also be imaged with MIRI at 25.5 microns (F2550W filter) to provide an independent determination of its column density structure and allow us to trace the presence of low-mass protostars in its interior.
