## ABSTRACT

JWST observations of the early universe are revealing an excess of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and a commensurate large number of obscured high-z active galactic nuclei (AGN). The understanding and characterization of these dust-shrouded distant objects relies of local AGN templates, including emission from the dusty torus. Postulated several decades ago, and now with several competing models, it is only through the advent of JWST's near- and mid-infrared capabilities, fused with ALMA's (sub)mm wavelengths that observational constraints can be firmly placed on the torus and models that seek to explain its presence, maintenance, and relationship to the host galaxy. In this proposal we plan to obtain NIRSpec and MIRI spectroscopic and imaging observations for a complete sample of Seyfert galaxies at 14-27 Mpc that have ALMA resolved torus data. We will use the leading torus models to fit the JWST-ALMA data to determine the torus dust structure and geometry and compare and contrast the optimal torus model(s). Furthermore, we will explore the extended mid-infrared polar dust, including its temperature and morphology, and determine if the dust is shock heated, AGN heated, or is part of a nuclear outflow. Finally, the data will also probe other dust components, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and water ice. We will investigate the role of the nuclear gas content in protecting them from the harsh AGN radiation fields. We stress the connection of our local AGN work with JWST high-z observations, leveraging our local knowledge to help understand the coevolution of the AGN and host galaxy.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

Our proposed NIRSpec-IFU and MIRI/MRS survey targets a complete X-ray selected sample of 12 Seyfert galaxies. For each target, we will obtain one pointing of the central region to cover the full 2.9-28 micron spectral range, except for those observed in Cycles 1-2 or to be observed in Cycle 3 (see Table 1), which do not need new observations. The area covered by NIRSpec-IFU is 3"x3", while that of MIRI/MRS varies from 4"x4" to 8"x8". We will use a 4-point dither for the galaxy observations. For MIRI/MRS we will obtain additionally a background observation for each target with a two-point dither, as recommended for the pixel-based background subtraction method. For all the MIRI/MRS observations, we will obtain simultaneous MIRI imaging with three filters. We selected the background regions such that the simultaneous imaging covers the central region of the galaxy for one of the possible PA ranges of the observations. Some targets have several ranges of PA, so in time the background coordinates could be changed accordingly to cover the galaxy center with the simultaneous imaging. The chosen filters F1000W, F1500W, and F1800W for the MIRI simultaneous imaging will map the mid-infrared emission on larger scales than the MIRI/MRS. For the NIRSpec-IFU observations we will obtain the leakage calibration observation. Since most of the targets have a bright central point source, we adjusted the readout modes to avoid saturation at the AGN location.
