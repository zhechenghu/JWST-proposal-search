## ABSTRACT

ALMA observations of the Herbig Ae/Be star HD 97048 show a kinematic kink within a sub-mm gap at a separation of 0.45". The postulated planet has not been detected directly by ground-based observations as it would too faint. However, with a predicted mass of 2-3 MJup (from hydro simulations), NIRCam coronagraphy should be sensitive at these separations. We would propose to observe with the M335R mask using simultaneous filters F200W+F444W in two rolls.
