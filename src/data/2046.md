## ABSTRACT
The cold dark matter paradigm predicts that self-gravitating structures known as halos should form down to Earth masses. Below virial masses of ~10^8 Msun most of these halos must be devoid of stars and gas to match observations of Milky Way satellites. Thus, detecting the predicted population of dark halos below 10^8 M sun would be a triumph of the cold dark matter paradigm. Conversely, their absence would imply that dark matter cannot be cold, but must be of a more exotic nature. Strong gravitational lensing provides a direct probe of dark matter as lensed image fluxes and positions are sensitive to very low mass perturbations due to dark matter halos both within a lens galaxy and along the line of sight. We propose to measure the strongly lensed flux from the cold dust torus surrounding the accreting super-massive black hole powering quasars. The cold dust torus is an ideal source, as its size (~ 1-10 pc) is large enough to avoid microlensing, yet small enough to be sensitive to 10^7 Msun halos. This measurement will enable us to detect or rule out a warm dark matter mass function with a turnover as low as 10^6.5 Msun, equivalent that of a 10 keV thermal relic, for example. If we detect the turnover, we will prove dark matter is not cold. If we do not detect the turnover at these masses, nearly two orders of magnitude below the limit at which halos are expected to be mostly dark, it will prove the existence of a significant population of completely dark halos, verifying a key prediction of the cold dark matter paradigm. JWST MIRI provides the only possible means of attaining the flux and spatial precision at the wavelengths necessary to make this measurement.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will take images in four MIRI bands for each of our targets, with a combination of either F2550, F1800W, F1280W and F550W or F2100W, F1800W, F1280W and F550W. We will use a 2 point dither pattern to minimize overheads.

We have no orientation or timing restrictions
