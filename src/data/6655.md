## ABSTRACT

We request bi-monthly observations of the LMC astrometric field for monitoring of the NIRISS photometric stability and as a quick check on the astrometric stability of the instrument. This is a continuation of cycle 1 calibation program 1515 and cycle 2 program 4475.

This calibration program may change in response to system developments and the final Cycle 3 science program.

## OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

We will observe the same position near the south ecliptic pole at one month intervals to assess the stability of the NIRISS detector over time. Inter- comparison of the stellar brightness values over time should show any long term changes in the NIRISS detector response or the overall system response. While some of the stars in the field will be variable, we will be able to eliminate these stars and make measurements on other stars within the field of view.

The target for this observation is the LMC astrometric field. This is a continuation of program 1515 in cycle 1 calibration and program 4475 in cycle 2.
